       " 'The region between the tliirty-eightii aiui tiie tuity-first parallels was thus open to colonization by both companies, with the stipiUatioti that neither company should establish a settlement within one hundred English miles of a pre- vious settlement made by the other.',\n",
       " 'Roughly speaking, this domain included all that part of the Atlantic seaboard extending from the latitude of the extreme southern boun« dary of Maryland (thirty-seven degrees fifty-three minutes) to that of the southernmost boundary of Connecticut (forty- one degrees).',\n",
       " 'The only colonial settlements of impor- tance within the present jurisdiction of the Middle States and Maryland that were not approximately within these limits were the towns and villages situated in the Hudson and Mohawk valleys, and at the extreme eastern end of Long Island.',\n",
       " \"Of these, Albany, Schenectady, I'^sopus, and Southold were of the most consequence during the colonial period.\",\n",
       " 'The historv of the Middle States and Maryland is thus identical, for the most part, with an account of the development of this belt of debatable land.',\n",
       " 'The colonies within this zone, since they lay between New England on the north and east and Virginia on the  MIDDLE STJTSS AND MARTLAND.',\n",
       " 'south, were greatly influenced by the religious, political, social, and economic institutions of both these sections.',\n",
       " 'Territorial proximity to one or the other of them resulted in the dominance of its characteristic institutions, as against those of other neighboring colonies.',\n",
       " 'Maryland responded more readily to the influence of Virginia, for example, while New York and New Jersey borrowed more largdv from New England.',\n",
       " 'From one to the other of the two extremes, there was a gradual and almost imperceptible transition.',\n",
       " 'Undoubtedly, the main factors in establishing these differ- ences were economic and physical.',\n",
       " 'Reference is made here, however, only to the influences exerted by the colo- nists of Virginia and New England upon the settlers of the territory in question.',\n",
       " 'This does not mean that the Middle colonies as a group had no life, no institutions, no development peculiarly their own, that they were merely the resultant of the two forces exerted upon either side of them.',\n",
       " 'On the contrary, this group of colonies had a history of its own essentially unique and unquestionably distinct from that of the Southern colo- nies and that of New England.',\n",
       " 'The fact is not so obvious, however, that it appeals at once to the casual observer or-cven, possibly, to the his- torian; and this may be the reason why the Middle colonies have never received historical treatment as a territorial unit.',\n",
       " 'Each of them has had its representative historians, at whom no one .can level the criticism of inertia.',\n",
       " 'Some of their histories are admirably done and stand as monuments of scholarly attainment.',\n",
       " 'The scope of these, however, is no broader, for the most part, than a single State, and in sunic instances it is limited to the confines of a county or a town.',\n",
       " 'As a result, the local InsLory ot each colony has been ade- quately and even generously treated, while the intercolonial history has been neglected entirely.',\n",
       " 'The object of the present narrative is to show, first, that the Middle colonies possessed important characterisiics and interests in common.',\n",
       " \"For they afibrded, to a greater extent   AUTHOR'S PREFACE xiii  than any other part of the English colonial possessions in North America, a place of refuge for the oppressed of all lands and creeds } and nothing is more duuracteristic of them^ during the period under consideration, than the general toleration of the religious beliefs of aU dasses.\",\n",

       " 'To work this conglomerate mass into a form fit for incorporation into the prospective Nation was a task different from that of any other section.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, on account of these common characteristics and interests, and on account of the fact that the colonies were constantly brought into contact with one another through their many boundary disputes, they present a territorial and political unity that admits of a special and indc[u ndi iit study.',\n",
       " 'Particular emphasis has likewise been laid upon certain other matters o\\\\ intercolonial importance: namely, the grow- ing ascendency of England oyer France until the successful issue of the 1 rcnch and Indian War; the in^portance of con- temporary European politics whenever it throws light upon colonial events; and the causes of the American Revolution in so far as th^ had their roots in the early colonial period.',\n",
