EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION

Trb history of Amefkftn colonication is to most persons
the record of the activities of the Cavalier and the Furitani
Litde thou^t is given to the story of the Dutchmen who
strove to create a New Netherland, or to that of the Swedes
who wund with the Dutch and dte English in the Dela-
ware country, nor, indeed, is much general interest shown
in the accounts of the foundation of New Jetacj, Delawaie^
or Maryland.

True, there is existent more or less local interest in sec-
tional history, and certain of the sons and daughters of the
Middle States, alive to the importance of their section
during the period ot colonization, have striven to perfect
the historical records of their several States and to place a
knowledge of them in the hands of the public. But when
wc sum up this local interest aad its effect we find that
even in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
wd Maryland public regard tor the history of the Middle
colonies does not bulk so large as the general, and we may
t&gt;jr popular, interest in the hiftory of the colonies of the East
and of the South during the early period of their existence*
^^n, therefoce^ the genenl mder consideii this period,
oabncing at it does the initial years of American coloniea-
tioa, his mind fastens more often upon Pljrmouth Rock and
JuMMown than upon Manhattan and St. Mafy's; and when
he studies the advanced or later stage of the period of colo-
ittzation, it is not to New Haven, New Yoric, Philadelphia,
&gt;nd Baltimore that he tarns, but to Boston and Chariestoo.

MIDDLE STATES AND MARTUUfD



Tbe general indifierence to mfttten of tecdonal histoiy

is, it is happily true, giving way before the efibits of such .'^
learned and progressive bodies as the historical societies of

New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland } but, nevecthdess,
the bulk of the people of the Middle States remain as unin-
te rested as were the bulk of the people of the Middle
colonies in the stirring events of their history, in the unsur- ^
passed record of those who laid surely and strongly the
foundations of such great States as New York and Feno-
sylvania. It is difficult to assign adequate reason for such ^'
attitude on the part of those who may well be ranked
among the most progressive and intelligent people of the
United States. Wc may we!! he puzzled as to a solu- *
tion of our perplexity when we ask ourselves to-day: Can **
any section of the United States boast of a city that sur-
passes New York in importance? or of four cities that
tum ther can outrank New York, Phil:Kl&lt;'li&gt;hia, Pittsburg, ■
and Baitmiore? And we might have ,\&lt;kvd ( urselves in the ■*
period of State buildinc;: Does any stcnuii possess greater *
aijd w c.ilrhier town^ ilian that of the Middle colonics ' But
we need jiot confine our questions to those concerning '
material prosperity. Were not the men of the Middle colo-
nies the peers of those of any section of the British posses-
sions? If the South bad Washington, the Middle colonics '
bad Fnmklin; if the South spoke of Jefierson, the Middle
colonies mig^t well boast of Hamilton; and if the New ^
England colonies declared the fame of Adams and Han-
cock, had not tbe Middle colonies Jaj and Morris i and
Maiyland was not behind its sister colonies in the possession
of great men.

Did New England or the South possess a more worthy
colonizer than William Pennf a more interest-compelling
figure than Peter Stuyvesant? or a more far-sighted pro- j
prietor than Cecil Calvert? Then, too, was the history
of New York, the Jerseys, and Pennsylvania less worthy of I
record than that of the colonies of the South and of New j
England? If we turn to Massachusetts because of Lexington !

EDITOR'S INTRODUCrwN



■diid Concord, and Lu the South because of Yorktown and
Cowpens, why not to the Middle colonies for the record
of Ticonderogg, Saratoga, and Valley Forge ? In fact, in
nothing were the Middle colonies mirpassed by those of the
Northeast and the South.

What, then, is the reason for the lack of interest in the
history of the Middle States, which stand tonlay as did their
forerunners— the Middle colonies — unsurpamed in men
and resources, and a glorious past ? The reply seems to us
to be unmistakable, though complex: The Middle colonies
and States, though always earnest and resultful in action,
have been slow to advertise their deeds. Then, too, inter-
est has centred in the South and in New England. The
South, separated from New England in thought and action,
was the land of Romance; this attribution coupled with
the notoriety given to the section by the agitation conccin-
ing its peculiar institution, the character of Southern IcadtTS
and the strength and success with which they maintained
any position assumed by them, combined to centre attention
upon the South and to bring the section into disproportionate
prominence.

The South, however, differed widely from New England
in that its praise as well as its dispraise came from those
not of its soil and in almost every instance not resident
within its borders. Because of this lack of local panegyr-
ists it is second to New England in the attention that has
been paid to its history in special and general works upon
American colonization.

New England possessed the radicalism of the South with-
out her picturesqiieness. Though not so rich in natural
resources, she was filled with the spirit of endeavor; but
radicalism, rrsoiirces, and progressiveness would not have
given New England her historical prominence had it not
been that she has possessed scores of authors and speakers
who have, in season and out of season, sounded the praises
of their section and its leaders. Traditions of the period
of New England colonization have been made the basis



Yiii MIDDLE STATES AND UAETLAND

of numberless publications. Literary industry and abilitjr
have magnified the importance of New England in the

creation and progress of the United States, and have made
the histor)" of New England a household word not only
in the section discussed and in the South, but in the iMiddle
States, where local history has until recent years been but
slightly studied and not generally Icnown. The result is
that all the country is familiar with the history of the Puri-
tan, but few are thev u ho know the history of the Quaker
or that of those sturdy culonists vvhu fuliowed the Dutch on
the Hudson or brought to naught the plans of Calvert.

This paiticularization of section is unfortunate, for if the
foundation of Boston is impoitant, so is that of New York;
and if New Haven is the basis of history, so, too, is Balti-
more. If Massachusetts has daim upon the attention of
the Pennsjlvaman, how much more so has Pennsylvanu
itself or Citdaware or New Jersey ? And what more profit-
able historical study to a native of New York than the record
of the growth of his own Bute? In fact, the Middle colo*
nies have as much claim to general study as any of those
communities which before 1776 fringed the Atlantic sea-
board. But the men of the Middle colonies have left their
deeds to be related by others, and these have not f^ivcn their
heart to the task. Those men who laid the foundations of
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, and Dela-
ware were too busy with their personal work, too busy with
their labor in advancing colonial, and, later, national, inter-
ests to spread abroad praise of themselves or to contest with
their neighbors to the south or east for control or place.
The descendants of the colonists have in great measure
followed the example of tfaeur ancestors.

This must not be understood as disparaging the work of
the historical students of the Middle States, which has claims
to serious attention and high praise. But, though scholarly,
this work has not aroused that popular interest which has
been created by the work of the men of New England,
neither has it spread abroad the fame of the Middle cdbniet

EDITOR'S JNtRODUCriON



aft the fame of New England and tbe South has been di8»
seminated through the nation and the world.

To-day there are signs of a revival of interest in the
histoij of the colonization of the Middle States. Readers
are turning to its record, but thef search and find not, for
the literature of the colonization period is all too scanty*
Tht-rc seems to he lacking a work that gives a detailed,
comprehensive, and readable descripticMi of the colonization
period in the terntory from which has been created the
states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania,
and Maryland. In view of this fact, the plan of The
History of North America allowed gi i crous space to
this pcrioU, and J be Co/onlzntiori of the Ahudii SiuUj und
Marylandy the present volume, is the result. Professor
Frederick Robertson Jones, iu author, has from the mass
of available source material succeeded in preparing a sym-
pathetic and comprehensive study of his subject. His
volume approach^ the ideal of a schohrly and readable
history, presenting in succinct form a wealth of detail.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE

Arc oRDTvn to the charter of the great joint-stock com-
pany granted by James 1. in 1606, the jurisdiction of the
London branch, or Virginia Company., was to extend from
thirty-four to forty-one degrees of north latitude, while that
of the Plymouth branch, or North Virginia Company, was
to stretch from forty-five down to thirtv-eieht degrees.
The region between the tliirty-eightii aiui tiie tuity-first
parallels was thus open to colonization by both companies,
with the stipiUatioti that neither company should establish
a settlement within one hundred English miles of a pre-
vious settlement made by the other. Roughly speaking,
this domain included all that part of the Atlantic seaboard
extending from the latitude of the extreme southern boun«
dary of Maryland (thirty-seven degrees fifty-three minutes)
to that of the southernmost boundary of Connecticut (forty-
one degrees). The only colonial settlements of impor-
tance within the present jurisdiction of the Middle States
and Maryland that were not approximately within these
limits were the towns and villages situated in the Hudson
and Mohawk valleys, and at the extreme eastern end of
Long Island. Of these, Albany, Schenectady, I'^sopus, and
Southold were of the most consequence during the colonial
period. The historv of the Middle States and Maryland is
thus identical, for the most part, with an account of the
development of this belt of debatable land.

The colonies within this zone, since they lay between
New England on the north and east and Virginia on the

south, were greatly influenced by the religious, political,
social, and economic institutions of both these sections.
Territorial proximity to one or the other of them resulted
in the dominance of its characteristic institutions, as against
those of other neighboring colonies. Maryland responded
more readily to the influence of Virginia, for example, while
New York and New Jersey borrowed more largdv from New
England. From one to the other of the two extremes,
there was a gradual and almost imperceptible transition.
Undoubtedly, the main factors in establishing these differ-
ences were economic and physical. Reference is made
here, however, only to the influences exerted by the colo-
nists of Virginia and New England upon the settlers of the
territory in question.

This does not mean that the Middle colonies as a group
had no life, no institutions, no development peculiarly their
own, that they were merely the resultant of the two forces
exerted upon either side of them. On the contrary, this
group of colonies had a history of its own essentially unique
and unquestionably distinct from that of the Southern colo-
nies and that of New England.

The fact is not so obvious, however, that it appeals at
once to the casual observer or-cven, possibly, to the his-
torian; and this may be the reason why the Middle colonies
have never received historical treatment as a territorial unit.
Each of them has had its representative historians, at whom
no one .can level the criticism of inertia. Some of their
histories are admirably done and stand as monuments of
scholarly attainment. The scope of these, however, is no
broader, for the most part, than a single State, and in sunic
instances it is limited to the confines of a county or a town.
As a result, the local InsLory ot each colony has been ade-
quately and even generously treated, while the intercolonial
history has been neglected entirely.

The object of the present narrative is to show, first, that
the Middle colonies possessed important characterisiics and
interests in common. For they afibrded, to a greater extent

than any other part of the English colonial possessions in
North America, a place of refuge for the oppressed of all
lands and creeds } and nothing is more duuracteristic of
them^ during the period under consideration, than the general
toleration of the religious beliefs of aU dasses. This policy
entailed, furthermore, the serious problem of assimilating a
population of many nationalities. To work this conglomerate
mass into a form fit for incorporation into the prospective
Nation was a task different from that of any other section.
Secondly, on account of these common characteristics and
interests, and on account of the fact that the colonies were
constantly brought into contact with one another through
their many boundary disputes, they present a territorial and
political unity that admits of a special and indc[u ndi iit study.

Particular emphasis has likewise been laid upon certain
other matters o\ intercolonial importance: namely, the grow-
ing ascendency of England oyer France until the successful
issue of the 1 rcnch and Indian War; the in^portance of con-
temporary European politics whenever it throws light upon
colonial events; and the causes of the American Revolution
in so far as th^ had their roots in the early colonial period.

The narrative ends with the repeal of the Sramp Act and
the passage of the Declaratory Act, when the first phase
of the Revolutionary period may very well be said to have
dosed. The plan of the work has not admitted of foot-
notes. Consequently, bibliographical citations have been
limited to those authorities from which important nutterial
has been quoted. Rather than make the few references to
sources that insertion in the body of the text would permit,
it has been considered preferable to omit them entirely.

Grriteru] acknowledgment is due to a friend and associate,
Mr. Ciordon Hall CJerould, of the Department of Enfjlish,
Bryn Mawr College, for reading the proofs of this book;
likewise, to Miss Ala Bibb Jones, of Philadelphia, for valu-
able assistance in collecting materials.

BdKir DUTCH SBTTLBMBNTS ON THE
HUDSON, I6is-i64r

" Those Dutch are strong people. They raised their
land out of a marsh, and went on tnr a long period of time
breeding cows and making cheese, ami miirht have gone on
with their cows and cheese till doomsday. But Spain comes
over and says : * We want you to believe in St. Ignatius.'
*Verv sorrv,' replied the Dutch, ^ but wc can't.' '■Ciod!
buL yuu iiiuit^' says Spain i aiul they vvcut about wiih guns
and swords to make the Dutch believe in St. Ignatius.
Never made them believe in him, but did succeed in breaks
\ng their own veitebrd column forever, and laistng the
Dutch into a great nation."

Thus does Carljk devote a number of teeth of his Teu-
tonic saw to the Spanish, whoee persecution of the Dutch
made possible the extension of the lattei^s commercial power
to America. Emerging strong from the fight for religious
libefty; compelled by the physical condition of their soil to
become a maritime nation— -the Dutch studied the weak
and strong points of Spain, and studying, saw, and seeing,
soon overcame her.

"Brave Little Holland" fell heir to Spain's commercial
supremacy and turned it to a far better account than that
decaying nation had done. Not until the passage of Oliver
Cromwell's Acts of Trade in the middle of the seventeenth
century was Holland's commercial supremacy threatened.

She was the carrier of the larger part of the world's com-
merce; consequently she was the first to see the anomalies
of the commercial principles of mercantilism. While Eng-
land and other countries were making ineffectual laws pro-
hibitory of the exportation of the precious metals, Holland
was removing all restrictions to their natural flow. It was
perfectly evident to her that commerce was not a gambling
scheme by which one country lost and the other gained ; or
that the gain or loss depended upon the astuteness or the
reverse of the gambling nations. It soon became evident
to a commercial nation like Holland that commerce was an
advantage to both trading nations; that one received fair
value for its superfluity of c niniudities while, at the same
time, it received those commodities from abroad which were
in great demand.

It was perfectly reasonable then that Holland, the des-
tined carrier of the world's commerce, should take early
advantage of the discoveries of the Spanish, Portuguese,
English, and French explorers of the century succ^ding
the landfall of Columbus. During the years 1 49 7 and 1498,
John and Sebastian Cabot, having discovered Newfound-
land, saUed along the coast of North America from Labrador
past what was to become the port of New York, and may
have proceeded as far south as the coast of what is now
Florida. They claimed for their sovereign, Henry VII.
of En^and, under whose commission they sailed, the entire
territory which they occasionally saw at a distance." This
discovery became the sole historical basis for the English
claim to the Hudson River valley in the struggle of the
nations that took place during the third quarter of the seven-
teenth century.

In the spring of 1524, the Florentine, Giovanni da Verra-
zano, coasting north from the Carolinas under the French
flag of Francis I., probably entered the harbor of what is
now New York. He gives a very interesting description
of that bay, but made no landing. The first Dutch ships
to venture upon American seas were sent out in 1510. In

th.it year, 1 hailes V. had granted an island in America to
the bicur licvercn, who "dispatched two armed vessels in
search of his new estate.*' furthermore, in 151 2, Anthony
Molock ventured to the Cape Verd Islands in a Dutch
vcnel. We may say, in fact, that by the time Oiarles V.
came into poMeaaion of the Low Countries, Dutch vetsels
were no uncommon aig^t on the waters of the New World.

The year 1566 was a veiy important one for Holland,
commercially as well as politically. That year, Philip II.
of Spain determined to root out die Reformation from the
Low Countries. As a result, in 1567 seven of the eleven
provinces of the Spanish Netlierlands revolted. This lost
to Holland the advantages she had enjoyed as a part of a
great and powerful commercial nation. For, by an edict,
the subjects of Spain and Portugal were prohibited from
trading with the rebellious provinces.

The loss to the Low Countries was only temporary, how-
ever, for in the end it led to the development of the Dutch
East India trade. This, in turn, was largely instrumental
in causing ventures to be made in the western seas. In
fact, two citizens of Amsterdam sent several vessels to the
West Indies in the latter part of 1597. The next vear
the city of Amsterdam despatched more ships to the same
welters. Furthermore, it is held that in the same year several
Dutchmen in the employ of the Greenland C^ompany actu-
ally built two small torts for protection against the Indians
during the wuuer months on territory destined to become
iN'ew Netherland. One of these forts is said to liavc been
built on North River and the other on South River — that is,
on what are now Hudson and Delaware Rivers.

In 1602, the &amp;ates General obliged the various tradbg
companies to incorporate under the title of the East India
Company. This was done for political as well as com-
mercial reasons. And what is more to the purpose, its
incorporation was one of the most important reasons for
the formation of that later trading association, the Dutch
West India Company. It was not until the early fiill

of 1609, however, that the Dutch made a serious attempt
to extend their influence to American Waters, and then it
was under the leadlership of an Englishman. It was Heniy
Hudson's third unsuccessful attempt to find a northwest
passage to China. The iirst and second attempts had been
made under the English flag, and the third was under that
of Holland. After trying ineffectually to discover a route
to China in the latitudes of Newfoundland, Penobscot Bay,
Cape Cod, and Chcsnpeake and Delaware Bays, he nnrhored
in the waters of i he Great North River of New Nether-
land." This was on the morning of September 4th. After
sailing up the river almost as far as the site of Albany In his
endeavor to discover a route to China, Hudson returned to
England, and shortly after his arrival there he severed his
connection with the Dutch East India Company.

The conditions in Holland were ripe for talcing advan-
tage of the explorations of Henry Hudson. The Dutch had
harried the Spaniards, their tyrants, even in "the remotest
recesses of their extensive possessions." Jacoh Heemskerk
dealt a crushing blow to their maritime supronacy in 1607.
As a result of this victory, Spain was more than ready to
conclude a truce in the following year. In fact, the inde-
pendence of the Dutch was practically if not technically
recognized and the nation was free to push forward its
commerce.

It did not take the practical Dutchman long to realize
the great prospect opened up to him m America. For
twoscore years and more he had not had the opportunity
of directing his trading energies into the proper channels.
The Spanish duel had entirely occupied his time. Now,
however, the opportunity was offered and the place and the
materials. Europe needed furs and needed them badly. The
supply had been drawn from Russia at considerable cost and
in limited quantities. Now they could be had in America in
abundance and in exchange for the merest baubles.

Because of this, an expedition was sent out by some
Amsterdam merchants in 161 0. The ships were loaded

with a varied cargo of goods that would most likely attract
the eye of the savage or appeal to his practical sense. So
successtul was the expedition that others were sent out at
frequent intervab during the next five years. They also
proved veiy remunerative.

The Dutch showed their practical sense in the selection
made for the first sites of their trading posts. The mag-
nificent harhor approaches to New York City would have
impressed the explorer of any nation as admirably suited to
a commercial station. But the early Dutch settlers were
commercial only to the extent of buying furs from the In*
dians at small cost and shipping them to Holland for manu'&gt;
facture. In consequence, the magnificence of the harbor
did not impress the early Dutch settlers as much as did the
possibilities for traffic afforded by Hudson River. Here was
a great river piercing the very territorial centre of the fur-
trading Indians and navigable for Dutch ships at least one
hundred and sixty-six miles. Not far from the mouth of
the river was an island about thirteen and one-half miles
long and var\^ing in width from a few hundred yards at each
end to two and one-quarter miles, the whole comprising
about twenty-two square miles or fourteen thousand and
eighty acres. The shores of this island were swept by the
great river and its tributary and a continuation of the great
sound. The water upon three sides was naturaHy adapted
to harbor purposes. The island was admirably situated for
commanding the traffic of North River and its tributaries.
•In fact, it is probable that Adrian Block, another Dutch
explorer, visited Manhattan, made a landing, and established
a trading station as early as i6ii« This was protected by
two small forts.

By reason of its favorable position, Manhattan soon be-
came the headquarters of the traders under the superin-
tendence of Hendrick Christiansen. Under his guidance,
the whole country was scoured, even to the exploring of the
smallest creeks and rivulets, m the hope of promotinyr the fur
trade. Christiansen was interrupted in his ettorts by a most



8 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND

portentous event. In 1 6 13, Captain Samuel Argall, of Vir-
ginia, returning from an attack upon Port Royal in Acadia,
decided to stop over at Manhattan. By way of asserting the
priority of his own claim to Manhattan, he compelled the
Dutch trader '^to submit himself and his plantation to
the king of England and to an:rcc to pay tribute in token
of his dependence on the English crown.**

No doubt this interruption to the Dutch fur traffic led to
a movement to secure the exclusive right to the trade of
the new country. In answer to a formal petition, the States
General passed an ordinance, March 27, 16 14, having that
end in view. This gave a practical monopoly of the fur
traffic to any persons making new discoveries. The monop-
oly was to last four voyages. The ordinance caused con-
siderable activity among Dutch merchants, particularly those
of Amsterdam and Hoom. Five ships were sent out almost
immediately under Adrian Block, Hendrick Christiansen,
and Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May.

Block's vessel was burned shortly after reaching Man-
hattan. He constructed a yacht and continued his explora-
tions along East River, and up Connecticut River as far
as latitude forty-one degrees forty-eight minutes— calling it
Fresh River. May explored southward as far as the Dela-
ware cape's. On their return, these three explorers made
a report to the States General and submitted a map in which
the new country is called "New Ncthcrland'* for the hrst
time (October 11, 1614). A special grant was made in
favor of the interested parties, and the trading association
was named the United Netherlands Company.

Active preparations were now made to promote the enter-
prise to its fullest capacity. A trading house thirty-^x
by twenty-six feet was erected on an island at the head
of navigation on the west shore of the great river, just
below the present city of Albany. A strong stockade fifty
feet square was built around the house, and the whole
was encircled by a moat eighteen feet wide. A primitive
battery of two pieces of cannon and eleven stone guns

mounted on swivels was manned by a garrison of ten or
twelve men.

Almost at the same time, Christnmsen erected another
fort on an elevated spot on the southern eactremity of the
island of Manhattan, nearly on the site of an insignificant
establishment erected in 1613. Thus were estabHshed in
1 614 Fort Nassau, at the head of navigstion, and Fort
Amsterdam at the mouth of the Hudson. The post at the
mouth of the river was the centre of the activities of the
Dutch. Here the ships of the new company came every
year to bring supplies and trading goods. Here the traders
at the advance post up the river brought peltries and carried
back the trinkets and cloths for the Indian?. The ships re-
turned to Holland heavilv freighted with valuable furs, t on
Amsterdam became the factor between Holland and the
fierce Indian tribes like the Mohawks. Fort Nassau was
the advance post, finely situated for tapping the fur resources
of the upper Hudson, Mohawk, and C^hamplain valleys —
even from "the distant castles of the Jbivc Nations to the
hunting grounds of the Minquas."

The mnsion of the Dutch in America was trade. Success-
fid trade necessitates peaceful relations between the parries
engaged in trafficking. This was the constant object of the
first Dutch settlers. It is evidenced in the vefy earliest
rehrions between the Dutch and the Indians. One par-
ticular event proved of continental and international im-
portance. This was the treaty of Tawasentha, between
the Dutch on the one hand and the powerful Iroquois and
their allies on the other hand. This treaty with the Five
Nations was momentous in its consequences, not only to
the Dutch colony, but to the whole country. On a hill
called Tawassgunshu by the Indians, on the banks of the
Tawasentha, or Norman's Kill, this treaty of alliance anJ
peace was consummated. The belt of peace was held as
a sign of union ; the calumet was smoked, and the toma-
hawk was buried; and the Dutch promised to build a church
over the buried tomahawk to prevent its being dug up.

Here, two miles below the present site of Albany, after
the abandonment of Fort Nassau, the Dutch under Jacob
Eelkens had already built a foiti^ed trading house. The
treaty was agreed to the same year, 1 6 1 7, and remained un-
changed for twenty-eight years. It was renewed in 1645,
and was continued without any breach on either side till
the English g^ned the country.

This was the auspicious beginning of those friendly re-
lations between the Dutch and the Iroquois confederation.
England, on the conquest of New Netherland, received it
as an important legacy. During the entire continuance of
that mighty duel between England and France in two conti-
nents, the advantages of that primitive treaty were manifest.
The French, under Champlain, had aroused the animosity
of these Indians. The Iroquois stood as a barrier between
the two combating forces. When the Iroquois were not
definitely leagued with the English they were, for the most
part, neutral. Where the two great contestants were so
evenly matched in many respects as were the English and
French in America, this powerful neutral confederation held
the balance of power. Speculation is dangerous, but it is
safe to assume that had the Iroquois been enemies of the
English rather than friends or neutrals, the final expulsion
of the French from North America would have been in-
definitely delayed; and, as a consequence, the independence
of the thirteen English colonies. It is impossible to exag-
gerate the importance of the neutrality of the Iroquois in
this great struggle. It is well not to underrate the impor-
tance of this treaty of Tawasentha, which led gradually to
that friendly neutrality.

The exclusive grant to the New Netherland Company
expired by its own limitations on January i, 16 18, and
the States General refused to grant a renewal. The suc-
cess of the East India Company led to a movement for
the establishment of a West India Company. As early
as 1602 the suggestion had been made that such a com-
pany would prove a success. William Usselincx, a man



EARLY DUTCH SETTLMMENTS

well versed in Spanish-American trade, was the principal
projector.

It is voy intemdiig to note what were tome of the
leaions luged for the foimatioa of such a company. Stress
was bud upon the Dutch grievances against the Spaniards ;
the feitUity of the soil and the firiendliness of the people
of the newly discovered huid; the desire of the Indians to
be allied with the Dutch against the Spaniards; that these
Indians were not the savages most Europeans thou^t them;
the abundance of the salt to be had for the taking; and but^
the urgent calls to Christianize these same savages* All
were invited to subscribe to the stocks of the venture. In
fact, the proiert met with general approval. A charter was
drawn up, and was being duly considered by their high
mi'^htinesses, when peace or truce proposals were received
h um the archduke which temporarily interrupted the progress
of the scheme.

The return of the expeditiun ut flenrv Hudson in 1609
revived the agitation for the incorporaiiuii or the new Com-
pany. But conflicting interests of those engaged in the
monopolistic trade of New Netheriand resulted m neutral-
izing the efibrts of all contestants. Further agitation for
the old monopolistic privUeges would have proved fruttlessy
however^ for in 1621 was chartered that great armed
commercial association," the Dutch West India Company.
It was modelled after its predecessor, the Dutch East India
Company. In fact, the former was designed to cooperate
with the latter in the charter-avowed objects of extending
nntional commerce, of promoting colonization, of cru'^hing
piracy, but, above all, of humblintr tlic pride and might of
Spam. For executive efficiency, the Company was divided
into ti ,'e branches, or chambers. These were established in
the djtierent cities of the Netherlands, and their managers
were styled Lords Directors. The Amsterdam branch
was the must impoiiaat., and to it were assigned all affairs
rehting to New Netherlands The general supervision
of the Company was in the hands of a board of Nineteen

MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



Delegates. After 1629, nine of these were from the bruich
at Amsterdam; four from Zealand; two from Metise;
and one each from Friesland, the North Department, and
Groningen. The nineteenth was appointed by the States
General.

Even a most cursory review of the privileges of this
corporation would indicate its enormous latent power. It

had exclusive control of the trade of Africa from the Tropic
of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope and the coast of
America from the Straits of Magellan to the extreme north.
It was authorized to form alliances otiensive and defensive
with Indian tribes, and was obligated to advance in every way
possible the material welfare of the lands taken up for com-
mercial and colonization purposes. The Company was
given power to make laws and to administer them^ to build
forts } to declare war and to make peace with the consent
of the States General. With the approval of the States
General, the Company could appoint a director-general and
all other necessary officers, whether civil, military, or judi-
cial; the only qualification being that they should swear
allegiance to the States General as well as to the Company.
This director-general and his council had judicial, leg^la-
tive, and executive power. Some supposed an app^ to
Holland was permitted, but that privilege was nevec recog-
nized in practice. The will of the Company was to be
law, as expressed in its instructions and ordinances, marine
or military. In cases not provided for, the Roman Law,
the imperial statutes of Charles V., the " edicts, resolutions,
and customs of the Fatherland were to be received as the
paramount rule of action.**

The States General guaranteed freedom of navigation
and traffic within the territorial limits prescribed in the
charter. Also, the same power agreed to furnish a miilion
of guilders and, in case of necessity, a certain minutely
defined naval armament. The naval armament was to be
furnished only on condition that the Company should main-
tain a much laiger naval establishment and support the

whole. The combined forces were to be under an admiral
appointed and instructed by the States Geneial*

The charter was purely that of a commercial company
with the belligerent end in view of taking every opportunity
of dealing Spain a severe blow; and it contained no pro-
visions favorable to individual freedom $ nor did it provide for
the welfare of prospective colonists in America. It must
be said) however, that in this respect it did not differ from
the patents establishing the only existing colonies in America
at that time, namely, Florida, Canada, and Virginia.

These, then, were the powers of the governing corpora-
tion that controlled the affairs and guided the destinies of
New Netherland until the passing of the Dutch sovereignty.
Not until two years after its incorporation — that is, in
1623 — did the Company begin oj^erations. Serious obstacles
had arisen and it was found desirable to amplity the charter.
Also, various explanations were added. The approval of the
States General was finally secured on June 21, 1623.

Amidst all these preparations a moat ominous note of
warning was sounded. During the two years in which the
West India Company's charter was in an embryonic state,
Dutch private merchants continued to make lemuneiative
trips to Manhattan and other North American points. The
authority to make these ventures was had under a provision
continuing the old license under which traders had previously
engaged in trafficlcing with the New World.

The remunerative quality of this trade did not fail to
excite jealou^ on the part of Englishmen who were inter-
ested in Virginia and New England. From the time of the
voyage of the Cabots, England had asserted an unostenta-
tious claim to the whole North American coast, from the
Spanish possessions in the south to those of the French
in the north. At this time, 1621, this claim was being
asserted with considerable vigor by those interested in the
English colonies on the triple grounds of "first discovery,
occupation, and possession." In support of this contention,
these individuals exhibited their charters and letters patent.



14 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND

The knowledge that a g^t and powerful Dutch com-
mercial company had been chartered led those especially
interested in English claims in America to bestir themselves
in taking definite action. They presented a remonstrance
to James I., who, through the Privy Council, instructed the
British ambassador at The Hague to make representations
with reference to these proposed invasions of English rights.
There is little doubt hut that this protest was the first "offi-
cial assertion hv the lirinsh government of the illegality of
the Dutch settiemeiu on the continent."

The British ambassadur made the protest in a perfunctory
manner, and the States General received it in an equally
perfunctory manner. In fact, it could not be shown that
the Dutch had actually made any scttltineiits vvithiii the
bounds of the territory under dispute, although it was found
that they had made discoveries. The wrangle—if, indeed,
this mere formal protest could be properly so called — was
terminated for the time being by the death of James I.
The incident is important not so much by reason of any
immediate danger of the English taking material steps to
assume possible possession of New Netherland as for its
bearing upon subsequent Dutch-English relations. When
taken in the light of the Argall incident of 1613, — to which
reference has been made, — together with subsequent inci-
dents of like character, the protest assumes an importancp
out of all due proportion to its bearing upon the period
under discussion. It is but one of the links m the chain of
evidence adduced to support a continuous English claim
to the territory settled by the Dutch under the name New
Netherland. The validity of this claim and the relative
merits of that of the Dutch are subjects that will be treated
at length in another chapter.

By 1623, the West India Company had finished its
preparations and had drawn up the articles of agreement
between the managers and other adventurers. The tern-

Netherkiid sent out by the Dutch West India Company
was under the auspices of the chamber of Amsterdam, under
whose superintendence the province was pbced. In March,
1623, the two&gt;4iundred-«nd««ixt7-ton ship Ntw NahtrUmd
sail^ from Holland, and after a voyage of two months
arrived [)fT Manhattan. The colonists were, for the most
part, Walloons. They were of French extraction, dwelling
an the southern provinces of Holland, and had originally
intended to immigrate to Virginia, but had been refused
advantageous terms. The expedition was under the super-
intendence of Cornclitis jncobsen Alay.

At the mouth of the Hudson were found two vessels — a
Frenchman and the Dutch yacht Mackerel. The latter had
been despatched the preceding year for purposes of recon-
naissance. It had traded with the Indians up the Hudson
and had returned in time to meet the first colonists. The
captain of the French vessel insisted on taking possession
of the territory in the name of the French king, but he
was persuaded from doing so by a timely display of camion
hy the MatktriL

The passengers of the Niw NtthtrUmd were distributed
at strategic points in the three great river valleys. Eig^t
men were left at Manhattan ; two families and six men were
sent to Fresh River (now the Connecticut); a party was
settled on the west shore of Long Island 1 and several fami*
lies were settled at a spot in the vicinity of the present
town of Gloucester, New Jersey, where they erected Fort
Nassau. The last-mentinned was the first settlement of
Europeans on the Delaware, 01 South River, as it was then
called. A majority of the colonists, however, or about eight-
een families, under the leadership of Adrian Juris, a director
under May, continued up Hudson River. They erected
Fort Orange upon the bite laid out the preceding year.
This site was on the west bank of the river, a few miles
north of the redoubt which bad been erected in 1618 on
Tawasentha Creek — about thirty-six Dutch miles from the
island of Manhattan.

These families were not colonists in the strict sense of
the word. They had no well-defined intention of settling
down and cultivating the soil. They were rather Company
servants engaged in the purchase and preparation of furs for
shipment. Some of them returned home after the expira^
tion of their term of service. It was not until several years
later that colonists began to come in earnest. By the end
of the first year, J oris returned with a cargo of vnlunhle
furs. In 1625, -Peter Eversen Hulft, of Amsterdam, sent
out three vessels at his own risk, laden with seeds, stock,
and farming implements. When William V erhulst assumed
direction of the colony in the same year, the population had
grown approximately to two hundred persons.

The colony was now beginning to assume a more per-
manent aspect. This was particularly true in the following
year, 1626, when Peter Minuit, of Wesel in Westphalia,
came out as Director-general of New Netherland. A col-
ony of Wallooiis, in the meantime, had settled at first on
Staten Island. Later on, they removed to the northwest
extremity of Long Island at a point called Wahlebocht, or
the **bay of the foreigners**— ^w corrupted into Waiia-
bout. Subsequently, these settlers spread westward to the
extremity of the island which was called "Breukelen" —
now Brooklyn — after a Dutch village of that name on the
river V&lt;: [^:ht in the province of Utrecht.

The government of the colony was now placed in the
hands of Minuit and his council of five. This council,
with the director-general, had manitoid powers. It exer-
cised supreme executive, legislative, and judicial authority,
both civil and ciiniinal — subject, of course, to the Company
in Holland. The prosecuting officer was the schout pual^
who played the triple role of sheriff, attorney-general, and
supervisor of customs.

Minuit signalized the beginning of his admintstntion by
purchasing Manhattan from the Indians (1626). There
were about twenty-two thousand acres, for which the thrifty
Dutchmen paid In truck the fum of sixty guilders, or, in the

money of to-day, about ^120. The Indians did not luidef^

stand the European principle of alienation of land. There-
fore, mnnv transactions similar to this transference of
Manhattan sniirkcd somewhat of the shrrwd bargain.

About the same time, Eghquaons, or State n Island, and
Cj'.u'crnnr's Island were secured in verv much the same way.
On the soutli point of the newly acquired Manli ittan a block
house was erected. Red cedar palisades surrounded it, and
it appeared formidable enough to the Dutch to be callt^d
Fort Amsterdam. It served likewise as the executive build-
ing, and may be called the first capital of New Netherland.
The island wig then a ^'mass of tangled, frowning forettf

No sooner had the little colony been fairly launched than
it began to have a foretaste of the difficulties that were in
store for it in the future. Troubles with the Indians were
fortunately few, and those that were encountered were due
to the indiscretions of the Dutch themselves. On the other
hand, the little colony was in no manner responsible for
the jealousy of the English and the silent schemings of the
French. A word concerninc: each ot tlicse difficulties :

Between the Mohawks and the Mohegans there was deadly
enmity. The Mohawks were Iroquois, aiu! the Mohegans
were Algonquins. The former dwelt on the west side and
the latter on the east side of the great river. In 1626 a
war party of Mohegans crossed to Foit Orange and in-
duced the commander, Krieckebeeck, to lead six men of
the gurison in an attack upon the Mohawks. The Mo-
hawks did not wait to be attacked, but did the attacking.
Kfieckebecck was slain with an arrow; three of his men
were tomahawked, and the Mohegans were put to flight
with fftat slaughter. The Dutch say Tymen Bonwensen
**was eaten by the savages after he had been well roasted.'*
The Mohawks justified their actions on the ground that

. they had been wantonly attacked and had merely defended
themselves. Xhe new commaiidcj j&gt;aw the strength of the
defence, renewed the old treaty of alliance, and the incident
was closed. It was thought advisable, however, to n :rio\e
the families fr^Mn ] ort Orange to Manhiman, and lo replace
them with a uarnson of sixteen men under K.rol, one of
the recently arrived consolers of the sick.'* This Indian
trouble had both a good and a bad result. It taught the
Dutch not to meddle in iiitertribal quarrels^ but it no doubc
kept tettlen mwmy for about two jean. And because of it
the little colonj on the Delaware was deserted and opeiationB
were suspended on die Connecticut.

The trouble with the Eng^sh was at the dme of a veiy
mild character, but in the light of subsequent events it was
one of those ominous douils that forebode a storm. We
must not lose sig^t of the hst that duringthis time protests
from the colonists in New England continued to pour in at
the English court. The English had been settled at New
Plymouth f r six or seven years. It was not long before
the thrifty Yankee and the commercial Dutchman heard
of each other through the Indians. Director Minuit trans-
mitted a very courteous letter to Governor Bradford, of
New Plymouth, oflfering to engage in a mutually reniuncra-
tive commerce. Governor Rrndford replied just as courte-
ously but naively asserted the En^^li'^h claims to New
Netherland by warning the Dutch against vessels belong-
ing to the other English plantations which were commis-
sioned to capture and expel all strangers trading within
the limits of forty degrees. To this communication die
authorities at Port Amsterdam replied couneouslv, though
firmly maintaining their right to the territory in question.
They cited the fact that for twcniv-six years they had
authority to trade in that territory direct from the States
General and the Prince of Orange. This claim of legality to
their tide was accompanied by a runlet of su^ and two Hoi*
land cheeses. The latter were thankfully thougjh cautiously
received. Bnulford suggested an aihitradon commission to

consider the mutual advantages of trade agreement. The
Dutch eagerly accepted this invitation, and Isaac de Razier
was sent as ambassador and arrived "honorably attended
with a noise of trumpets." This was "the first meeting
in the solitude of the New World between friendly colonists
of two allied European nations." As a result, a brisk trade
sprang up between the English and the Dutch colonists.

The question of jurisdiction, however, was only settled
tempoiaiily. The Company obtained from Charles I. in
1627 an order in council declaring that by the treaty of
Southampton all English ports were open to the Dutch.
This protected Dutch vessels trading in New Netherhmd
from seizure by English cruisers*

In the meantime, the French were planning the extension
of their power in America. In 1624, Richelieu, with con-
summate genius having overcome all obstacles, ha4 taken
upon himself the sole direction of the policy of the govern-
ment of Louis XIII. That policy now began to assume a
certain decree of consistency. For the most part, it was
necessarily concerned with domestic and European affairs.
But Richelieu was not unmindful of the future importance
of America, and outlined a policy of large extensions of
power in that direction. Little or no headway was made
toward the carrying out of this policy until the reign of
Louis XIV. By reason of alleged priority of discovery,
the French laid claim to the territories settled by the Eng-
lish and Dutch and protests were made against the pos-
session of such territories by these two nations. The little
colony was thus threatened not only by the indiscretions
of its own citizens, but particularly by France and Eng-
land, which were unanimous in their assertion that the
territory did not belong to the Dutch. This French claim
was but another warning added to that already sounded by
the English.

In 1627 the Dutch won a series of brilliant victories over
the navy of SpairL The prosperity of New Netherland
was profoundly affected by these victories. Especially by



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



that one in which a Spanish silver fleet of nineteen vessels
was captured, with booty equal to about ^30,000,000, by
Admiral Peter Petersen Heym In command of dw diijM
of the Dutch West Indta^ Company. Great wealth was
thus thrown into its coflers. It declared dividends equal
to fifty per cent of its capital, and its prosperity gave a
woefully needed impulse to the permanent colonization of
New Netherland. Nearly seven years had elapsed since
the incorporation of the Company, and nearly five years
since it began active operations. Nevertheless, that part
of the charter which bound the corporation to advance
settlement and encourage population ** had been ignored.
Practically the only inhabitants of New Netherland were
the servants of the Company who were engaged in the fur
trade. Scarcely any soil had been reclaimed, and the only
exports were furs. The Company saw that its sole source
of income was from the fur trade. That state of atFairs was
unsatisfactory when it was realized what an extremely fertile
and well-favored country New Netherland was. The cost
of the establishment was out of proportion to the returns,
and the internal al&amp;irs of the colony were exceedingly
irregular.

These facts had heen before the Assembly of the Nine^
teen, the governing body of the Company, for some time,
and colonial, seignioral, and manorial schemes for develop-
ing the colony and making it a more prosperous investment
were discussed at some length and with much heat. At
one of the meetings, when the commissioners for the States
General and other notables were in attendance, a draft of
a "charter of privileges and exemptions" was drawn up
which wns considered advantageous to all parties interested
or who might become interested as colonizers. The report
was referred to a committee for exaniinaiion and for later
reference to the Nineteen. Heym's victory occurred just at
the right time. By it the committee was greath inHucnccU
in its consideration of the draft. Finally, aiter numerous
amendments and frequent references to the committee.

the Nineteen agreed to the draft, June 7, 1629. Shortly
afterward it was ratified by the States General.

This was the famous charter of privileges and exemp-
tions." It consisted of thirty-one headings and is the charter
that founded the patroonship of New Netherland. "This
charter, which transplanted to the free soil of America the
feudal tenure and feudal burdens of continental Europe, is
remarkable principally as a characteristic of the era in which
it was produced. It bears all the marks of the social system
which prevailed at the time, not only arnoiit: the Dutch, but
among the other nations which had adopted the civil law.
The colonies were but 'transcripts* of the * lordships' and
' seigneuries * so common at this period and which the French
were establishing contemporaneously in their possessions
north of New Netherland, where most of the feudal ap-
pendages of high and low jurisdiction, mutation fines, pre-
emption rights, exclusive monopolies of mines, minerals,
watercourses, hunting, fishing, fowling, and grinding, which
we find enumerated in the charter to patroons, form part
of the civil law of the country to-day." There is no doubt,
however, that the charter was extremely faulty. It was too
thoroughly aristocratic and placed a premium upon slavery
and servitude. Agriculture was fettered and manufactures
were prohibited. On the other hand, the rights of the In-
dian to the soil were respected, the building of churches
and schools was enjoined, landholdiiiL-; In freemen was en-
couraged, and the colonists were exempted from taxation
for ten years.

The charter provided that anv member of the Company
who, within the next tour years, should settle m New Neth-
erland along the Hudson or any adjacent river hhy grown-up
persons, should be given a grant of land. This estate he
was to hold as ^ patroon," or lord of the manor. The grant
might have a frontage of either sixteen miles or eight miles,
depending upon whether it extended along one side of the
river or both sides. No definite limits were fixed as to
the distance the estate should extend back from the river.



MIDDLE STATES AND MAKrUND



The patroon held hit estate in fee, and could devise it at
death. He was chief magistiate and had supreme authority
in cases involiring fifty g;uilders or less. In other cases,
appeal could be made to the director and council at New
Amsterdam. This provision was easily evaded by roquiring
a promise from the colonists to forego this right. During
the period of exemption from taxation the colonists could
not move from one estate to another. Land was to be
cleared, houses and barns were to be built, and cattle and
tools were to be furnished — all by the patroon. For this
advance of capital, the patroon received a fixed rent, pay-
able usually in kind, and also a percentage of the increase
of stock and a part of the crop. In addition, the patroon
had a first option upon the "snle of the farmer's produce.
The latter must erind his jrain at the patroon*s mills and
must get a license to hunt and fish. Should he die intestate,
the patroon became his legal heir.

There were numerous aggravating trade restrictions. The
Company reserved to itself a monopoly of the fur trade.
The patroons could trade u iih whomsoever they wished,
but were compelled to do so through the port of New
Amsterdam as a factor, where an export duty of five per
cent was collected by the Company. The manufiKtuie
of cotton or woollen cloths was prohibited. This was done
as a concession to the Dutch manufacturers. Shveiy was
permitted and even encouraged. The Indians were to be
paid for their land. Certain Dutch writers have made much
of this fact, but it is not entitled to stress. The English of
the Atlantic Colonies, with the exception of the acquisition
of the territory of the Pequods by conquest, invariably gave
an equivalent acceptable to the Indians for land acquired
from them. The Dutch, it may be added, did the same and
may therefore receive the same credit, but no more.

The charter was in substance thoroughly undemocratic.
It attempted to introduce a feudal system where such a
system was totally out of keepmg with the natural condi**
tions. It could not prove attractive to men who had enjoyed



EARLY DUTCH SBTTLBMBUrs 23

the privileges of freedom, whatever attraction it migjht have
to Dutch merchants who expected thereby to raise their
social standing by means of landed possessi(&gt;ns and terri-
torial rights, which mere trading in cotton and gin could
not accomplish for them.

Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert, two of the Com-
pany's board of directors, secured the first manor under the
new charter. This grant and the one in the tuiiowing year,
1630, lay upon botli siiics ol Delaware Bay in what is now
Delaware and New Jersey.

Kilian van Renwdaer, a lapidary of Amttenlani and a
liiiector of the West Indfia Company, was kd by the flat-
tering reportt of Kiol to invest in lands in the vicinity of
Foit Orange under the terms of the new charter. Purchase
was made in 1630 of a tTKt of knd on the weat side of
North River. It extended northward from Barren Island
to Smack's Island and ^ two days journey into the interior."
This together with subsequent purchases included the greater
portk&gt;n of the land now contained in Albany, Rensselaer,
and Columbia Counties, except Fort Orange itself, which
rematned in the possession of the Company. The colony
was called Rensselaerwyck, and the first colonists ron'^!&lt;;ted
mostly of farmers who were well provided with cattle and
agricultural implements. Wolfcrt Gerritsen was overseer of
farms, and Gillis 1 l ossct was special acrent for Rensselaer. It
was at the suggestion of Hossct that much more land, north
and south ul 1 ort Orange, was subsequently purchased.

Michael Pauw, another director, took advantage of the new
charter. In the summer of 1630 he bought from the natives
the whole of Staten Island and the territory including the
Hoboken and the Jersey City of to-day. The purchase
of Staten Isfamd was approved by Director-genend Minuit,
July 15, 1631. The name Pavonia was given to the manor^
and the coJony maintained itself on the New Jersey side
of the river for about seven years. In the end, how-
ever, it did not prove profitable and Pauw sold out to the
C6mpany.

MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



The patroon system soon brought on a conflict with the
Company. Van Rensselaer formed a stock company to
develop his holdings. By agreement he was to have no
rank or authority superior to his associates except such as
went with the title patroon.*' His partners were bound
to do fealty and homage for the fief on his demise in the
name and on behalf of his son and heirs." The object of
the patroons seems to have been, at this time, the develop-
ment of the Indian trade rather than the development of the
country. By the fifteenth article of their charter they claimed
the right to trade with the Indians, not only along the coast,
but in the interior — in fact, at any point where the Com-
pany did not have representatives at the time the charter was
granted in 1629. The fur trade was simply irresistible to
the patroons. They were shortly accused of trading in fur
on their own private account and thus interfering with what
the other directors clanncd to be their "vested rights."
Mutual ICC nininations followed, until the competition forced
a revision of the Articles of Freedom. As a result the privi-
leges of the patroons were somewhat curtailed. This did
not settle the difficulties. The patroons continued to en-
croach upon the rights of the Company, and, in the end,
blocked the attainment of the very object for which the
patroon system had been created — that is, the growth of an
agricultural colony.

The quarrel was referred to the States General, and inci-
dentally Director*&lt;general Peter Minuit was recalled in 1631.
This was due, no doubt, in part to the fact that the vast
alienations of the public domain had taken place during
his administration. He was thought to be too favorably
disposed toward the patroons. Minuit looked upon his
recall as imfair and unwarranted treatment. 1 he struggle
over the appointment of a successor lasted two years, and
colonization and sculement were retarded in consequence.

In 1633 Wouter van Twiller, or " Walter the Doubter,"
as Irving calls him, came over as director-general. The
appointment was a great surprise, for Van Twiner's sole



EJRir DUTCH SMTTLBMESrs



distinction, apart from being a clerk in the employ of the
Company at Amsterdam, was the fact of his havmg married
the niece of Kiiian van Rensselaer and that one of the Rtn-
sselaers had married his sister. Van Twiller was a man of
no wide reach of intelligence. He had been piven up to
the routine of the office, and his appointment seems to have
been a clear case of nepotism. He arrived at Manhattan
in April, 1633, in the warship Southberg^ 01 twenty guns,
accompanied by one hundred and four sokliers. With him
came Dominie Eveiardiis Bogardus, the first clergyman, and
Adam Roehmdson, the first schooUnaster, of the province.
No sooner was Van Twiller installed in his new govem-
mentf and had assumed its responsibilities, than he began to
experience its difficulties. Troubles with the ubiquitous
Yankees, with the treacherous Indians, and with his own
recalcitrant Dutch, began to surround hinu His conduct
amidst those difficulties brings down upon him the ridicu-
lous description of Irving : With all his reflective habits,
he never made up his mind on a subject. . . . His
habits were regular. He daily took his four stated meals
appropriating exactly an hour to each ; he smoked and
doubted eight hours, and he slept the remaining twelve of
the four and twenty. Such was the rrnowned Wouter
van Twiller, — a true philosopher, for his mind was either
elevated above, or tranquilly settled below, the cares and
perplexities of this world.**

In spite oi what Ifvmg has to i,ay ab(mt the "doubting"
propensities of Van Twiller, the colony presented at least
the appearance of prosperity under his administntion. At
New Amsterdam, the fort was reconstructed and a guard-
house and barracks were built. At the same time that a
plain wooden church was constructed to take the place of
the ^loft used for religious purposes," a house was erected
for the midwife,*' Also a dwelling and a stable were
buik for the use of Dominie Bogardus, and "mansions"
were constructed for the Honorable Mr. Gerritsen and the
director-general. There were also erected a bakehouse, a



26 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



boathouse, a goat*s stable, houses for the smith, cooper,
and corporal, a corn grist mill, and the inseparable brewery.
Improvements were made, likewise on South River and at
P^vonia, while at Fort Orange the inhabitants rejoiced in
the possession of an elegit large house, with balustrades
and eight small dwellings for the people." In truth. Van
Twiller had large ideas of the resources of the Dutch West
India Company. Those resources were largely apparent,
however, and Van Twiller lost sight of the fact that the
chief essential to the prosperity of the colony was agricul^
tural settlers. Hardly one haid as yet been sent over to
reclaim the wilderness.

Van Twiller had difficulties at home and abroad. The
trouble was principally with the Rarit:iii Indians, although
open hostilities broke out between the Dutch at Fort Good
Hope on Fresh River and the Pequods, The origin of the
trouble with the Raritans is in doubt. In 1634, Van Twiller
succeeded in concluding; an aci\ unr^igeous peace with them.
However, this misuntlcrstanding led to more serious Indian
troubles in the next administration.

The trouble at home was the old question as to the re-
spective rights of the patroons and the Company under the
charter of 1629. Each interpreted the charter differently.
The Cbmpany would confine the patroons exclusively to
agriculture. The patroons claimed that they had already
expended a **ton of gold" on their three colonies and that
their charter gave them the right to unrestricted trade along
the coast and in the rivers^ and, as successors to the Lords
Sachems from whom they purchased," also the right to ex-
clusive commerce and jurisdiction within their patroonships.
The matter was brought before the Company, the Nineteen,
and Anally before the States General, and was not settled
until several years later.

The administration of Van Twiller closed with two addi-
tional quarrels — one with the minister and the other with
the schout fiscal [sheriff] . The cause of the trouble between
Van Twiller and Bogardus is nut known. Can it be traced



EARir DUTCH SBTTLEMENrs



to the bibulous habits of both? The cierg^an is repre-
sented as calling the director child of the Devil, a con-
summate villain . . • and to whom he should give
such a shake on the following sabbath, from the pulpit, as
would make him shudder." On the other hand, the min-
ister is represented as "having demeaned himself towards
the director in a manner unbecoming a heathen much less
a christian, letting alone a preacher of the gospel."

The schout fiscal, Lubbertus van Dincklagcn, criticised
the director-iieneral for what he called his irregular conduct.
He no doubt referred to both his olhcial and personal con-
duct. Similar criticism was levelled by the schout fiscal at
B&lt;^;ardii$. In fact, drunkenness seems to have been not
at all uncommon. The explorer De Vries wrote that *^he
was astonished that the West India Company should send
such fools to the colony, who knew nothing but how to
drink themselves drunk • . . that the company would
soon go to destruction." In fact. Van Dincklagen's prede-
cessor in office, Notelman, was somewhat of a bowser and
when dry would not keep from his wine.** It was for that
reason that he was recalled and Van Dincklagcn, an honor-
able man and a doctor of laws,** was appointed in his stead.

Van Twiller arraigned the schout fiscal, condemned him
to lose his wages, — which were three years in arrears, — and
shipped him off to Holland. This was virtually depriving
him of his office, which he held direct from the chamber of
Amsterdam. Van Dincklagen returned in the summer
of 1636, and memorialized the States General. He de-
manded a redress of his grievances and called attention to
the maladministration in New Netherland. Bogardus was
included in his accusations. The States General continued
to urge matters so strongly that the Assembly of the Nine-
teen removed Van Twiller in 1637 under charges. Never-
theless, he feathered his nest before leaving office by securing
many acres of desirable land from the Indians.

William Kieft was commissioned director-general, Sep-
tember 2, 1637. He arrived at Manhattan on the 28th



28 MiDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



of March in the year following. One of his first steps was
the organization of a council. His method of retaining

entire control was as simple as it was unique. There were
exactly two in the council, Kieft and the Huguenot physician
Jean de la Montagne. Kieft gave the Huguenot one vote
and kept two for himself. This council managed the gen-
eral affairs of the government. And badly, indeed, did they
need managing. The fort was tumbling down and could
keep nothing in or out. The guns were ofF their carriages,
and were serving ihe very prosaic purpose of furnishing
rustic benches for the town loafers. Ail the vessels except
two were falling m pieces, and these two were as yet not
completed. The property of the company was decaying, its
fields lay untilled, while those of the late director blossomed
as a rose. In the fur trade, the Company got the worthless
hides, while its servants and the patroons and the Yankees
got the best.

Kieft tried to rectify these conditions. All i&gt;ersons were
admonished to abstain from fighting, swearing, and other
immoralities.*' The tapping of beer during divine service
or after ten o'clock at night was strictly forbidden." Kieft

was an adept at fighting with edicts and proclamations.
Such long-range methods suited his style of belligerency.
His proclamations, moreover, resounded with a detonation
thunderous in direct proportion to the distance of the objects
against whom they were directed. If, perchance, it ^vas the
Swedes on the Delaware under Minuit, or the Yankees on
the Connecticut, both those valleys resounded with the
reverberatory sounds of Kieft's proclamations — i:ru\s ine in
intensity as they lengthened the distance from iManhattan,
People with less temerity would have succumbed forthwith.
But he always ended up by graciously permitting the objects
of his verbal fusillades to continue to exist where they had
settled.

A new era began in 1638* In September of that year
the monopoly of the New Netherlatid trade, which the
West India Company had enjoyed for sixteen years, was

abolished. This was done on the initiative of the Company,
after consultation with the States General. The fur trade
and the right to lands in fee were thrown open to every
person — citizen or alien. The Company reiained the sole
monopoly of carrying settlers and their commodities. The
prohibition on manufactures was also renewed. Immigration
was encouraged in many ways — free transportation was pro-
\ icit: d, and also the use of well-stocked farms for six years
on tile payment of a very moderate yearly rental. The
stock was to be returned at the end of that period, but all
increase was to be retained. Money and commodities were
lent when necessaiy.

The beneficial results were almost instantaneous. Not
only did the poor come over, but also the wealthy with great
numbers of stock tad dependent settlers. The population
was also recruited from New England and Virginia. The
first of the well-to-do Hollanders came with De Vries,
Christmas, 1638, and built homes on Staten Island. The
next year Thomas Belcher settled on the present site of
Brooklyn borough on Long Island, and Antoine Jansen, a
Huguenot, settled at Gravesend. The authorities in Holland
began to take a new interest in the colon)-. On July 17,
1640, a nen' charter was agreed upon, entitled "Freedoms
and Exemptions for all Patroons, Masters and private per-
sons who should plant colonies in, or convey cattle to New
Netherland." 1 he charter essentially modified the one
already granted. It did not affect the reform legislation
of 1638, but further enlarged the liberties of the ordinary
citizens by cutting down the privileges of the patroons.

Kieft's administration was characterized by his aggressive
policy toward the Indians, which led indirectly to a demand
on the part of the settlers for a share in the government of
the province. His first blunder was in 1 6^9. A demand
for tribute was made upon the Indians in return for imagi-
nary protection. At the same rime, an efibrt was used
to prevent the sale of firearms to them. The Raritans
were the first victims. They refused point-blank to render



MWDLE srim AND MURTUND



tribute to any man. As a result, several Indians were killed
and their crops destroyed. The Raritans took speedy re-
venge by tfifally destroying Dc Vries's color-v' on Statcn
Island. Bounties were placed on the heads ot the Raritans,
and the services of some red men were enlisted on the side
of the Dutch. Matters went from bad to \\ ^rse. Kieft
was compelled to summon the leading men ti&gt; an assembly
at Fort Amsterdam, August I'Sy 1641. Twelve men were
selected to consider the question of Indian relations. They
were all Dutdunen, and De Vriet was president. In speak*
ing of Kieft's ftifflmoning of the leading men of tlie colony
to an assembly, O'Callaghan says: **It was the fifst time
that their exittenoe as a component part of the body politic
had been recognized or their influence acknowledged.'* The
advice of the Twelve was practically for war, but with the
qualification that the hunting season should mark the open*
ing of hostilities, and that prior to their beginning ceftaun
concessions should be made by Kieft. In January, 1642,
after months of wrangling, the Twelve finally consented to
an expedition. But not until after they had obtained the
promise of the concessions from the director. He promised
a reconstruction of the council and that at least frnir of its
members should be c hosen by a popular \ (&gt;tL ; a removal of
restrictions on trade , the exclusion of New England cows
and sheep; and the increase of the currency. The director
never carncil uui hj&amp; pruinises. He dismissed the Twelve
aiid forbade, on pain of corporal punishment, public meet-
ings of the people without his order, as tending to dangerous
consequences. Van der Donck states very plainly that Kieft
allowed the twelve representatives to be chosen merdj to
serve him as a cat's-paw; that they had neither vote nor
voice in the council and were of no moment when their
opinions differed from that of the director-genend, who
looked upon himself as a sovereign in the country.

Kieft had been put in personal command of the expedi-
tion, which was to be furnished with munitions of war ftom
the Company's stores. It set out for Westchester County»

but IIS march ended in a ridiculouB Ailuie.. The Indians,
however, were scared into signing a treaty which stipulated
the delivery of the murderer of Claes Smit, who had been the
Yictim of the Rahtan nud upon De Vries's colony. This

provision of the treaty was never carried out.

Coincident with these political events in New Nether-
la nH, religious contrtn cf^ies stirred New England. These
sc !it ;i wave of migration to Kieft's dominions. Francis
Doughty came for "freedom of conscience/* which he
missed in New England. While preaching at Cuhasset,
he had been dragged from his pulpit and ejected for holding
that "Abralum's children ought to have been baptized."
He and a large party of followers settled on Long Island.
John Throgmufton, vviLh thirty-five English families, settled
on East River. He and Hugh Peters could not agree, and
the former was driven out ^for the free escercise*' of his
religion, Anne Hutdunson came also and settled not hr
from Throgmofton's party* This mflux of inmignmts
was recognized by the appointment of an English secretary
as an important c^cer. De Vries said the next thing should
be a r espectable church, and as an evidcBGe of good faith he
immcdiatdy subscribed one hundred guilders toward one.
Subscriptions were completed a few days later at the wed«
Sag HoM of Dominie Bog^us's daughter—- t^after the
fbufth or fifth round of drinking." The religious element
of the colony was recruited at the same time by the coming
of Dominie Jcrfiannes Megapolensis. He settled at Reosse-
laerwyck, and was the first cleigyman for that patroonship.

The remainder of the unfortunate rule of Kieft centres
around three important events — two of them vcr\' disas-
trous to New Nctherland, and all three closclv connected
and having as their result the recall of that unpopular and
inefficient director-general. These three important events
are: continued war with the neighboring inilians; the in-
cessant struggle on the part of the people of New Amster-
id;^ni for a voice in the government , and the ousting of
the Dutch by the English fiuai the Connecticut valley and

adjacent parts. The last will be considered in its proper

place in a subsequent chapter.

The war with the Algonquins was due to Kieft*s rash-
ness, stupidity, and inefficiency. His bad treatment of these
friendly tribes led to a horrible massacre of Indians and
their subsequent retaliation, until many of the Dutch were
compelled to flee to Holland or take refuge in thi towns.
The trouble oriirinated in january, 1643. ^ beaver-skin
coat was stolen trom a drunken Indian at Hackensack. In
retaliation, the Indian and his friends slew an unoffending
colonist, V^an Voorst. The tribe of the murderer oriered two
hundred fathoms of wanipum in compensation. De Vries
tried to persuade Kieft to accept the atonement; he refused,
demanding the surrender of the murderer. The chiefs
claimed that they were unable to deliver him, he h.i\ mg fled
up the river, Kieft ordered i'acham, chief of the Haver-
straws, to deliver up the fugitive.

This had not been done in February when a band of
ninety Mt^awkt twoc^Msd down upon the river tribes, de-
manduig tribute. As such a demand was usually accompanied
with sbughter, the terrified Algonquins fled towaid the Dutch
settlement asking protection. De Vries saw it was a fine
opportunity for diplomacy. But Kieft saw in it only an op-
portunity for wreaking vengeance for the murder of Smtt
and Van Voorst, Secretaiy Van Tienhoven and Corpond
Hans Stein were sent over to Pavonia to spy out the posi-
tion of the Indians. On the night of February 25th
and 26th, two parties left Fort Amsterdam ^ after having
the blessing of heaven invoked on the expedition," and
fell upon the sleeping, unsuspecting, friendly Indians to
whom a few days before they had sworn friendship. The
following is a graphic account of the afiair by De Vries, an
eyewitness :

"I remained that ni&lt;ihr at the DirccfnrV and took a seat
in the kitchen near the tire. At midnight, I heard loud
shrieks and went out to the parapet of the fort, and looked
toward Pavonia. I saw nothing but the flashing of the

guns. I heard no more the dies of the Indians. They
were butchered in their sleep!"

Eighty Indians were slaughtered at Pavonia and forty at
Corlear's Hook by the second party. " Sucklings were torn
from their mothers' breasts, butchered before their parents'
eyes, and their mangled limbs thrown quivering into the
river or the flames. Babes were hacked to pieces while fas-
tened to little boards, — their primitive cradles, — others were
thrown alive into the river, and when their parents, impelled
by nature, lushed m to save them, the soldiers prevented
them landing and thus both parents and offspring sank into
one watery grave. Children of half a dozen years; dc-
crepit men of thfeescm and ten, shared the same fate.
Those who escaped and begged for shelter next morning,
were killed in cold blood, or thrown into the river." — ^ Some
came running to us," says De Vries, ^from the country,
having their hands cut off; some lost both arms and legs;
some were supporting their entrails with their hands, while
others were mangled in other horrid ways, too horrible to
be conceived. And these miserable wretches as well as
many of the Dutch were all the time under the impression
that the Jittack had proceeded from the terrible Mohawks."

This crime has hardly a p;iialle1 in the annals of savage
atrocities — directed, as it was, upon friendly villages of harm-
less, unsuspecting Indians. The massacre of the sleeping
Dutch of Schenectady forty-seven years later by French and
Indians was not its equal. There, sixty persons were killed.
Peter Schuyler, Mayor of Albany at the time (1690), made
a mistake when, writing to Massachusetts for aid, he said :
"it was a dreadful massacre and murder, the like of which
has never been committed In these parts of America." He
had either foigotten or refused to recall the massacre of the
Indians at Pavonia and Corlear's Hook by men of his own
race just forty-seven years before.

The eleven river tribes immediately combined and retali-
ated upon the Dutch. Property was destroyed, colonists
were put to death, and the actual destruction of the province



MIDDLE STJTMS AND MARYLAHD



was imminent. At the same time a state bordering upon
anarchy existed in New Amsterdam. A truce was patched
up bc-twc-cn the factions, hut it \vas not lonL: maintained.
1 he situation became even more serious. The colonists
threatened to send Kieft to Holland for trial. At this point
the director thought it well to appeal once more to the
people. He asked tliat five or six persons be elected from
among themselves to consider such propositions as he should
submit for the general good. A board of Eight men was
chosen, and it met two days afterward, September 15, 1643.
Tlie board decided to make war upon the river tr^s, but
to keep peace with the Long Island Indians.

The Indians, as usual, did not wait to be attacked. They
"swept with fire and slaughter in every direction." Kieft
asked tot help from Connecticut, but it was not given. The
colony was practically rescued by the opportune arrival
of one hundred and thirty Dutch soldiers, who had been
sent from Cura^oa, in the West Indies, by Peter Stuyve-
sant [Stuijvesantl. The tide was turned. This, added to
Captain John Underhill's destruction of the Algonquin
stronghold in March, 1644, broke up the formidable league
of Indians. Before the end of April, the Long Island and
Westchester Indians had sued for (,eace. The war termi-
nated before the close of the summer.

On October 28th of the same year, the Eight sent
home a cumplaint to the directors of the Company. The
address was couched in the most condemnatory terms.
Famine threatened* They laid before the States General a
statement of their weakness and of the strength of the In-
dians. Likewise, the fact that before Kieft b^an his perse-
cutions of the Indians they had ^ lived as lambs among us."
The States General was warned against Kieft and the report
he had prepared, concerning which it was said: *^ If we are
correctly informed by those who have seen it, it contains as
many lies as lines." — ^'It is impossible ever to settle the
countjy until a different system be introduced here, and a
new Governor be sent out with more people, who shall settle

themselves in suitable places, one near the odier, in fonn
of villages and bamlets, and elect from among themselves a
bailiff, a schout, and a uhepin, who shall be empowered to
send deputies to vote on public aflfairs with the Director and
Council ; so that hereafter the country may not be again
brought into similar danger."

Both tlw^L- demands were granted in some degree by a
measure of local government and the recall of Kicft. It
v.as decided to vest the government in three persons, to be
called the Supn mc Council. These three were to be the
dircctor-gciicral, a vicc-di rector, and a fiscal, or treasurer.
Dele^tes from the commonalty were to meet every six
months at Manhattan ^for the common advancement of
the welfare of the inhahitantt." For the social well-being
of the colony there were Instituted other measures, namely :
the introduction of neg|x&gt;es from Brazil} allowance of gen-
end trade with that couhtiy; prohibition of the sale of
firearms to the Indians; and the appropriation for local uses
of the revenue drawn from tariffs on exports and imports.

By 1645, Kieft had signed treaties with the minor tribes
of Indians and with the Mohawks at Fort Onmge. The
latter treaty was confirmed at Fort Amsterdam on the 30th
of August — the Mohawks appearing as arbitrators for the
Five Nations. September 6th was appointed as a day of
thank«;fiivinrr «to proclaim the good tidings."

Before Kieft's withdrawal, he came into conflict with
Dominie Bogardus. "What," asked Bogardus, in i nc of
his sermons, "are the great men of this country but vessels
of wrath and fountains ot woe and trouble? They think of
nothing but to plunder the property of others, to dismiss, to
banish, to transport to Holland." Kieft accused the dominie
of drunkenness and sedition, and attempted to drown his
voice by the mttle of drum and the firing of cannon.

Upon the arrival of his successor, Kieft handed over
die administration of the colony amid universal rejoicings.
His administntion had ended prutically in 1646, although
it was 1647 l^fi^e he was superseded. Serious complaints.



36 MIDDLE srirSS AND MJRTLAND



charging him with nothing less than tyranny, extortion,
murder, theft, and other "heinous crimes," had been trans-
mitted to the directors of the West India Company. A
vote of thanks was refused him, and two of the Eight,
Joachim Kuyter and Cornelius Melyn, petitioned for a judi-
cial inquiry beginning: with 1639. This was refused by Peter
Stuy vesant, the new director-general, wl 10 luukcd upun it as
of the nature of an attack upon the sacredness of the direc-
torship. Their complaints were dismissed, consequently, and
counter charges were preferred ag^unst them. Melyn was
indicted for rebellion, sentenced to seven years' banish-
ment, to pay a fine of thirty guilders, and to forfeit all bene-
fits derived from the Company. Kuyter was indicted for
counselling treachery against the Indians, and was sentenced
to banishment for three years, and to pay a fine of one hun-
dred and fifty guilders. Kieft, Melyn, Kuyter, and Bogardus
all sailed on the ship Mncfss for Holland. Kieft carried
with him a fortune of four hundred thousand' guilders, and
also Kuyter and Melyn as prisoners. The vessel was wrecked
in Bristol Channel, and Kieft and Bogardus, to^r^^ther with
seventy-nine other persons, were drowned. Kiett is said
to have rcmarJced, in the midst of the danger: "Friends,!
have been unjust toward youj can you forgive me?" Thus
ended most tragically the careers of the two most turbulent
spirits in New Nethcrland. Kuyter and Melyn were res-
cued and reached Holland in safety. There they presented
their case before the States General.

The States General suspended Stuyvesant's sentence,
cited him to appear at The Hague to defend it, and granted
the appellants enjoyment of die full rights of colonists
in New Netherkind. In the spring of 1649 Melyn re-
turned to Manhattan in triumph with these documents.
He demanded that his triumph should be made as public as
his disg^ce had been. His demand was yielded to, and the
decision was read and explained by the authorities before
the people assembled in the chnrrh within Fort Amsterdam.
Stuy vesant yielded. ^ 1 honor the States, and shall obey their

commands," said he;^I shall send an attorney to sustain
the sentence." Stuyvesant's enmity did not stop with Melyn
himself. The latter*s son-in-law, Jacob Loper, was re-
fused permission to trade in South River. Melyn failed,
however, to secure a reversal or a mitigation of his sentence,
and returned to Holland to seek "tardy justice in the
l^atherland." He returned again in midwinter of 1650
with a new letter of safe conduct from the States General.
Again he became the object o{ persecution by Stuyvesant,
who had the ship in which he sailed together with its cargo
confiscated, although neither belonged to him. Summoned
to Ivlaiihauan on new charges, he refused to appear, and a
house and lot of his in New Amsterdam were confiscated.
The persecutions continued undl 1655, when he removed
to New Haven and took the oath of fidelity to its govern^
ment. In i66i,he sold out his patroonship in Long Island
to the Company, received indemnity for his losses, and was
given **• full amnesty with regard to all disputes." With
this settlement he retumed to New Amsterdam.

These unfortunate internal strifes did not absolutely
prevent the colony's expanding when once peace with the
Indians was restored. Brooklyn set up a municipal govern*
ment in 1646 and Long Island was prosperous.



CHAPT£R II



DUTCH AliD SffEDISH SETTLEMENTS ON THE
DELAiyASLE, 162^-164^

Coincident with the settlement of the Hudson River
valk^r, the Dutch attempted to plant colonies along Con-
necticut River and more especiallj along the shores of
Ddaware River and Delaware Baj. To tfaeae early settlers,
Hudson River was North River, the Connecticut was Fresh
River, and the Dekware was South River. The topograph-
kai conditions that attracted Dutch traders to North River
also attracted them to Fresh River and to South River. In
each one of the three cases there was a long navigable river
afibrding easy communication with the interior and conse*
quently with the fur-trading Indians. All three nver valleys
were densely wooded, and peopled with Indians who were
very friendly disposed toward the whites, who brought them
trinkets, domesric utensils, ammunidon, firearms, and, more
especially, fire-water. The importance of the fitr trade in
its bearing upon Dutch settlement must never be under-
estimated. The Dutch did not come to America primarily
to settle down and conquer the wildernes*?. None of the
early settlcmcjits were of a permanent character. Those
who came were mostly men and servants of the great
Dutch trading company. The habitations erected were
of the most temporary character, and were deserted for
others just as soon as new places promised greater advan-
tages incident to a traffic in furs. In fact, the Dutch were

at first exploiters, not of the soil, but of the Indians and
their furs. The topography of these three river valleys was
preeminently adapted to an industry of this character.

The first attempts at settlement on the Delaware were
made by the Dutch. Their claim to the territory was based
upon Lhe discoveries of Henry Hudson in 1609 (August
28thj, and the explorations of Cornelius iMay. There was
opposed, however, the indefinite English ckim to the terri-
tory as a part of Virginia, based upon the fifteenth cen-
tury discoveries of the Cabots. Delaware Bay had been
visited likewise in 1610 by Sir Samuel Argall, afterward
Deputy Governor of Vii]ginb, who named the bay after
Lord De La Warr. In 161 1, the latter visited the bay him-
self on his voyage homeward. It was not, however, until
1 6 14 that May sailed for Manhattan, encouraged by the
Ordinance of that year. Five ships had been fitted out by
merchants of Amsterdam — the Fortune^ belonging to Hoorn
and commanded by Cornelius May; the Tigit^^ commanded
by Hendrick Christiansen ; the F9x^ commanded by Captain
de With ; the Nightingale^ commanded by Captain Volker-
sten ; and another vessel named the Fortune^ commanded
by Adrian Block. While Block was exploring Ivong Island
Sound, May was cruising southward and finally arrived at
Delaware Bay. The east cape May named after himself,
and to the west cape he at first eave the name Cornelius,
also after himself. This, however, upon second thought
he changed to Henlopen, the name of a tuv/n in Friesland.
Shortly after May*s voyage. Captain Hendricksen, in the
yacht RtttUss (buUt at Manhattan), explored Delaware Bay
and River as nur north as the Schuylkill. Based upon the
explorations of these men, the merchants of Amsterdam
obtained from the States General a monopoly of the trade
along the coasts and rivers thus explored. The grant was
entitled the United New Netherland Company, and was in-
clusive of South or Delaware River. The monopoly was to
last for five voyages within the period of three years com-
mencing the first day of January, 1615. The decree was



uiyiiiz-Cu



DUrCH AND SWEDISH ON THE DELAifJRE 41



dated at The Hague^ October 1 1, 1614. James I. of
England had granted most of the territory eight years before
to the North Virginia Company. The monopoly ceased by
limitation in 1618, and an application for renewal was only
partially granted. No advantage was taken of the monopoly
on the Delaware or its branches.

It was not until 1623 that an attempt was made to estab-
lish a colony on the Delaware. It was under the auspices
of the Dutch West India Company. It was organized in
1 62 1 and consisted chieriy of Walloons. A vessel was
fitted out called the Nnu Netherland (a ship of two hun-*
dred and sixty tons), and sailed March, 1623, under the
superintendence of Captain May. After a voyage of two
months, the expedition arrived at Manhattan. Several
femilies of the expedition were sent to the Delaware, and
erected a second Fort Nassau at a place near Gloucester
Point — on the east bank of the river opposite the land now
covered by Philadelphia. Captain May accompanied the
settlers, but it is not known how long he remained. The
fort was very soon abandoned, and the Indians took posses-
sion of it. This was the case when De Vries visited the
site in 1633. No further attempt was made by the Dutch
to occupy the Delaware until 1631. In that year a colony
was established.

This unfortunate colony was the offspring of the famous
feudal charter of " Privileges and Exemptions" granted by
the Dutch West Indui C oinpany, June 7, 1629, and estab-
lishing the system ot patroonship so characteristic of Dutch
colonization in America. The Erst patroonship granted
under this charter was dated June 19, 1629, and was to
Samuel Godyn, a merchant of Amsterdam, and Samuel
Blommaert, both members of the Company's board of direc*
tors. The giant lay on the west shore of Delaware Bay,
extending from Cape Henlopen inland thirty-two miles, and
was two miles in breadth. In July, 1630, the purchase was
ratified at Fort Amsterdam by Minuit, then Governor of
New Netherland, and his council. It is the oldest deed for

land in Delaware, and comprised the water line of Sussex
and Kent Counties. The year following, Mav 5th, Peter
Heyn and Gillis Hossett purchased a district sixteen miles
square on what is now the New Jt^rscy shore — including
Cape May. This purchase was attested at Manhattan in
the following June, Representatives had been sent out prior
to this to examine the country and purchase lands from the
Indians. An Indian village at that tunc stood on the site of
what is now Lewes, and this site was no doubt included in
the grant. Godyn and Blommaert formed a partnership
with five other directors, including Van Rensselaer and the
' historian De Laet&gt; to increase their capital. Captain David
Pieters de Vries, of Hoorn, *«a hold and skilful! seaman,
and master of artillexy in the service of the United Prov«
inces," was offered a ^^conunandership" and employment
as second patroon." He declined this offisr and was made
a full patroon (October 1 6th). His services were considered
necessary by reason of his experience and business ability.
A ship of eighteen guns, commanded by Pieter Heyes, and
a yacht, the IP^alrus^ were sent out on December 12, 1630,
under command of Dc Vries, with thirty colonists. They
carried material for \\ }iaimg and for tobacco and grain plant-
ing, also tools and cattle. One vessel was captured by pirates
and the other arrived in Delaware Bay some time probably
in April, 1631, A landing was made in what is now Lewes
Creek, Sussex County — then called Hoornkill. A house
was erected and encircled with palisades. It was called
Fort Oplandt. It is said that from the number of swans
which De Vries had seen he called the place Zwaanendal,
or Valley of Swans." The arms of Holland were affixed
to a pillar, and the water in the neighborhood was called
Godyn's Bay. Says Bancroft : The voyage of Heyes was
the cradling of a State. That Delaware exists as a sepa-
rate commonwealth is due to this colony." In the course
of the year, De Vries returned to Holland, leaving Gillis
Hossett, the commissary of the expedition, in command.
Through the representations of De Vries, in whom the

patroons had great confidence, a second expedition was fitted
out. But before it sailed ncu '^ w:is received of an appall-
ing calamity that had befallen the unfortunate colony of
Zwaanendal: the fort had been destroyed and the colo-
nists slain.

This was ihe account that De Vries learned on his arrival
from one of the Indians whose confidence he gained;

The Dutch arms that had been erected upon the taking
possession of the country in the name of Holland consisted
of a piece of tin on nHiich the coat of arms of the United
Provinces had been traced. One of the Indian chiefs,
attracted by the glittering tin and not knowing its signifi-
cance, tore it down and made it into a tobacco pipe* The
Dutch foolishly looked upon this as a national insult, and
set up such a clamor that the Indians put the chief to death
for the sake of making amends. The family and friends
of the murdered chief wreaked a fearful revenge upon the
little colony. They slew all the colonists — including a large
bulldog, the guardian of the pence. They had more trouble
in putting the bulldog to death than they had in the case of
the colonists, for it took twenty-hvc arrows skilfully shot
before he rendered up the ghost.

When De Vries arrived on his second trip, therefore, he
found nothing but charred timbers and bleaching skeletons.
He regained the coiihdence of the Indians, though u iih
diiHcuky, and tried to retrieve the fortunes of the colony,
but without success. Whales were scarce, and he had no
disposition to plant com. Food was necessary, smd the
expedition returned to Holland. The patroons had been
quarrelling and the partnership was soon dissolved, so the
land titles on both sides of the bay were sold back to
the Company for fifteen thousand six hundred guilders.
««Thus," says De Vries,** terminated our £rst colony, to our
great loss."

But the Dutch were not destined to be the first colonizers
of what is now the State of Delaware. That honor belongs
to the Swedes. In fact, as early as 1 624, William Usselincx,



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



a merchant of Antweip and the original projector of the
Dutch West India Company, had drawn up a plan for
the promotion of a similar company in Sweden. The
scheme, from which originated the settlement of Delaware,
was approved hy Gustavus Adolphus, then King of Sweden,
perhaps because it promised to be the means of planting
Christianity among the heathen ; perhaps because by it there
was a possibility of extending the dominions of Sweden, of
enriching its treasury, and of establishing a lucrative foreign
trade. A company called the Swedish West India Company
was formed and a charter was granted to it on July 2, 1626.
Usselincx's description created a perfect furor among all
ranks in Sweden. Subscription books were opened and there
was great rivalry in securing stock, GusLav us Adolphus him-
self pledging the royal treasury to the extent of four hundred
thousand Swedish dolhurs. The project was in a fair way
to be executed when the Thirty Years' War and afterward
the death of the king at Lutzen, November 16,1632, caused
a complete coUapse of the undertaking. No attempt was
made at that time by the Swedes to settle America — not-
withstanding Campanius to the contrary. The project is
important, however, in that it was afterward carried into
effect in 1638.

A short time before his death, Gustavus Adolphus, while
at Nuremberg, had drawn up a plan for a company to settle
and trade with America. On the loth of April, 1633,
Chancellor Oxenstiern signed and published this plan. He
appointed as first director of the company William Ussel-
incx. But it was Peter Minuit, former Director-general
of New Netherland, who was to lead the first Swedish
colony to America. He had quarrelled with the Dutch
West India Company, and offered his services to the crown
of Sweden. He laid before Oxenstiern a plan tor the settle-
ment on the Delaware and offered to conduct the expedi-
tion. The patent which had been granted in 1626, during
the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, was renewed, and its privi-
leges extended to the citizens of Germany. Oxenstiern



uiyitized by Google



DUTCH AND SWEDISH ON THE DELAWARE 45



presented the case to Queen Christma, and Minuit was
commisauMied governor of the expedition.

The exact time of the sailing of the expedition is not

known, but it was probably in the fall of the year 1637, for
in the spring of 1638 we find that Kieft, the Dutch director-
general at New Amsterdam, officially protested against the
Swedish settlement. The expedition consisted of an armed
ship, the Kiv of' Kiilmor^ and a transport ship, the Gr'iffin.
There were about iitt\ persons, many of whom were cnmi-
naJs sejK out as mdeiited servants. They were well stocked
with food, munitions of war, merchandise for trading pur-
poses, and presents for the Indians. A clergyman, Renrus
Torkillus, accompanied the expedition. The vessels, sailing
by wav of the West indies, stopped at [aniestown, Virginia,
for ten days. After renewing the supply of waiei ^nJ u oud,
they proceeded to the Delaware, where they arrived in March,
l6j8. Shortly after enLcniig the bav, the advtMlurcri* landed
at a point of land in what is now Kent County, Delaware,
and called it Paradise Point. From here they proceeded up
the Delaware, and finally, on March 29, 1 638, made a land*
ing on Minqua Kill, the Christina, at a point now within
the city of Wilmington. Minuit bought several acres of
laiid iiom the Indians for a copper ketde and some trifles,
erected a foit and trading house, and gairisoned it with
twenty-four soldiers and h^an a small phuitation. The fort
was named Fort Christina, the creek Christina Creek, and
the settlement was called Christinaham.

To avoid possible collision with the Dutch at New Am-
sterdam, Minuit proceeded with as much secrecy as possible.
But, despite this, his arrival was soon known by the Dutch
at Fort Nassau, and on April 28th the assistant commissary
at that fort notified Kieft of the presence of the Swedes.
At the same time, the commissary sent Peter May to de-
mand of Minuit his license and commission. The demand
was refused. Jan J an sen, the clerk at Fort Nassau, was
then ordered to mnke a formal protest should Minuit commit
any acts disadvantageous to the Dutch. Kieft's declaration

agunst Minuit is a marvel of bombast in view of the fact

that the latter knew that the fonner was powerless to
' enforce it, being without money or troops. &lt;^ If," ran tht
protest) Myou proceed with building of forts* and culti-
vating the lands, and trading in furs, or engage further in
anything to our prejudice, we protest against all expenses,
damages, and losses, and \\'\\\ not be answerable for anv
mishaps, effusion of blood, troubles, and disasters which
your company might suffer in future, while wc are resolved
to defend our rights in ail such manner as we shall deem
proper."

Minuii paid no attention to Kicft's protef?t, but kept
quietly at work and finished Fort Christina. Furthermotr,
shortly afterward the laud from Cape Hcnlopen to the Falls
of Trenton was put t liascd by the Swedes from the Indians.
PafL of this land had alrcaJy been sold eight years before
by the Indians to Godyn. In fact, Dc Wies's unfortunate
colony of Zwaanendal was within the boundaries of the
grant.

The Swedish colony prospered during the first year, in
spite of the Dutch opposition. Thirty thousand skins were
exported, and the Dutch were constantly undersold. Within
two years came a change, and the little colony became dis-
couraged. The Swediw Company had fiuled to send addi-
tional supplies for the Indian trade, provisions were exhausted,
tiade declined, and sickness prevailed. In the spring of 1 640
the colonists resolved to remove to New Amsterdam. The
day before their contemplated departure, however, tlic Dutch
ship Fredenburg arrived from Sweden with supplies. The ship
sailed under the Swedish flag, although her passengers and
crew were HoUanders^Jacob Powelson being the captain.
The succor was most unexpected. The prosperity of the
Swedish colony had attracted notice in other parts of Europe,
and a company had been formed in Holland to make settle-
ments under the patronage of the Swedish Company The
Fredenburg had been sent out by this Dutch company. She
sailed from Holland in January and arrived in South i^ver

aome time during the ktter part of April or the Arst of May.
She was freighted with colonists, stock, and all supplies
necessary for a colonial establishment. A despatch was
produced from Chancellor Oxensuem and his brother, re-
questing the colonists to receive the emigrants in a frienflly
manner. Inf()rm:ition was given at the same time that two
other vcsslIs. would be sent out in the spring.

These Dutch colonists were settled a few miles from
Fort Christina. The terms of their charter gave them
permission "to form a settlement, at least five German
miles below Fort Christina, on both sides of South River,
and Cake up as much land as they could place in actual cul-
tivation in ten years." The chsirter was a very liberal one
and had been given at first to Gochaidt de Redden, William
de Horst, and otheis; but later to Henry Hockhammer
and others. They were gjyen fiill power over the land, and
with the cqnsent of the governor of the colony could remove
to other land if dissatisfied with what they had taken up
originally. Three florins for each &amp;mily were to be paid
to the Swedish crown in recognition of its sovereignty.
They were given the rig^t to conduct their own judicial
afiairs and to elect their own officers. They were to submit
their statutes and ordinances to the governor for confirma-
tion. A large amount of religious toleration was granted,
but all were rcqtiircd to "h've in peace, abstaining from every
useless dispute, from all scandal and nil ahiise." Ministers
and schoolmasters who were interested m the conversion
of the pagan inhabitants must be employed in numbers
demanded by the population. Freedoai in commerce and
manufacturing was granted them, but the commerce must be
carried on in Swedish bottoms. Gothenburg was to be the
factor between New Sweden and Europe. For ten years
they were to be exempted from import duties. After that
time they were to pay five per cent on all exports and im-
ports and were also to contribute toward the expenses of
keeping up the new colony. The relationship between
master and servant was set forth veiy dearly. Whoever

discovered mines of minerals could, with the consent of the
governor, retain a monopoly of them for ten years. After
that time preference was still allowed the discoverer on pay-
ment of an annual quitrent. Property was to be exempt
from taxation, and fines were not to exceed forty rix-dollars
[one hundred florins of the empire].

This was, in eriect, a Dutch colony withm a Swedish
colony. It is supposed to have been located in the neigh-
borhood of St. George's and Appoquiiuimiik Hundreds in
New Castle County — probably not over three miles from
the Swedish settlement. This would seem to be so from the
instructions of Governor John Printz, who protested that
the new settlement was considerably within the five-mile
limit specified in the charter of his colony. Jost de Bogardt
was probably the first governor of the Dutch settlement.
He was to receive two hundred rix-dollars per annum as
salary, which was to be increased by one hundred florins iff
in the future, he showed new proofs of his attachment and
of his zeal to promote the welfare of the colony and of the
crown. We have no information as to whether his salary
was incrensed or remained the same.

These emigrants were received joyfully. There was no
evidence of jealousy, and the spirits of the Swedes were
revived. They postponed indefinitely their departure for
Manhattan and went to work with a renewed vigor. In
the autumn of the same year, 1640, Peter HoUender and
Moens Kling arrived from Sweden with three ships loaded
with supplies for the' colonists. HoUender^ who had been
san officer in the Swedish army, had been appointed deputy
governor of the colony. New Sweden was now given a
new lease of life and prospered well. New lands were
taken up and new settlements were made. The next ytUy
1641, Peter Minuit, the first Governor of New Sweden,
died, and in 1642 was succeeded by HoUender. Little
is known of Hollender's character. He made veiy little
impress upon the struggjUng little Swedish colony, returning
to Sweden within a year an4 a half.

DUTCH AND SfTMDl^H ON THE DEUITJRX 49

It was during this period that a company of £n^h
colonists of the New Haven colony attempted the settlement
of the Delaware and the Schuylkill. Some of the leading
ro]f)ni&lt;;t«? of New Haven were London merchants, and were
among the wealthiest of the early settlers of New Eng-
land. Following out their original commercial schemes, they
began to establish coastwise trade with Barbatlues, Virginia,
and nearer points. As early as the winter of 1638—1639,
the colonists of New Haven learned from George Lamber-
ton, one of their citizens, of the valuable fur trade in which
the Dutch and Swedes on the Delaware were engaged.
Seizing at once the opportunity of gain, the leading colo-
nistSf die governor, and the minister of New Haven formed
the Delaware Company. Toward the end of 1640 the
company sent out a vessel to the Delaware under Captain
Turner. Under his supervision, most of the southwestern
coast of what is now called New Jersey waa purchased from
the Indians, as well as a piece of land on the present site of
Philadelphia, just opposite Fort Nassau and belonging to
the Dutch.

On August 30, 1 64 1, the New Haven town meeting
assumed control of these purchases. When the hfty families,
the first settlers, passed New Amsterdam, Governor Kieft
made a formal though unavailing protest. Most of the set-
tlers took up a position on Varicin's Kill, near the Salem,
New Jersey, ui lo-day. A fortified trading house was
occupied on the Philadelphia site [Passayunk]. The Dutch
and the Swedes took measures to oust the '-^ interlopers,"
and as a result of this opposition the settlement proved a
fiulure. Most of the settlers returned to New Haven during
1643, and the failure of the venture came near proving
the financial wreck of its New Haven promoters. The
attempts, however, were not discontinued, for we shall find
that coincident with efibrts to collect damages from the
Dutch for the destruction of the first venture preparations
were made and carried out for other enterprises in the same
territory.

So important had New Sweden become in the estimation of
the home authorities^ that on August i6, 1642, John Printz,
a heutenant-colonel of cavalry, was appointed governor.
His instructions ^vere dated at Stockholm a day earlier,
and in them tlu 1 oundaries of New Sweden were stated to
extend "from the borders of the sea to Cape Henlopen,
in returning southwest toward Godyn^s Bay, and thence
toward the Great River, as tar as Minqua*s Kill, where is
constructed Fort Christina, and from thence, again toward
South River, and the u holc to a pl.i^ c v\ hich the savages
called Santickon . . . the whole may be in length
about thirty German miles,** etc. From this it would seem
that the boundaries claimed by the Swedes extended from
Cape Henlopen to Trenton, New Jersey, comprising not
onlj the whole of Debwire, but t part of Pennsylvania.
Printz was to develop industiy and tiade, and live in atnitjr
as fitf as possible with his Dutch and £ng^sfa neig^ibois.
The friendship of the latter in Viiginia was to be partioi-
larly cultivated, masmuch as the Swedes roust depend for
supplies to a luge extent upon that colony. The Dutch
colony under Swedish sovereignty was to be carefully fos-
tered; but if they had settled nearer Fort Christina than
their charter allowed, they were to be required to femove
the full distance. The Indians were to be treated ^with
humanity and mildness,*' and neither violence nor injus-
tice " was to be done them. They were to be instructed
in the Christian religion, and goods were to be sold to them
cheaper than to the Dutch at Fort Nassau or to the English
near by. The latter was advised for the purpose of winning
the Indians over to the Swedish alliance. Printz was to
build himself a residence, and erect fortifications at Cape
Henlopen, James's Island [part of Camden, New Jerscv],
and other favorable places were to be fortiiied in such a way
as to "shut up** South River.

However, agriculture with particular attention to grain
and tobacco, sheep and cattle breeding, and salt manufacture,
were not to be neglected in any respect whatever. At the

tune time, &lt;*]iimlg or minenls" were to be sought, and
investigations were to be made as to the possible use of
tile great quantities of ttmber in the colony. Also, as to
whether oil could be pressed from the nut trees and whether
whale fisheries and silkworm culture might not be developed
to advantage. The laws and customs of Sweden " were
to apply to all judicial cases, while the governor was given
power to imprison for niaior offences or even to exact the
death penalty, hut, in every case, only after a fair tnai
be t ore the leading persons of the colony best versed in
judicial procedure. The Lutheran Church was to be estab-
lished — and divine services were to be performed "according
to the true Confession of Augsburg, the Council of Upsala,
and the ceremonies of the Swedish Church." Nevertheless,
the Dutch in New Sweden were not to be interfered with
in the use of their owe Rctoinicd tasth.

Pnutz's commission was for three year:&gt;, and his salary
was to be one thousand two hundred silver dollars [eight
hundred rix-doUarsl beginning January i, 1643. After the
expiration of the diree years^ he was to be pennitted to
return after having appointed a temporary successor. A
tax of two thousand six hundred and nineteen rixHtoOara
was allowed from the excises on tobacco for the expenses
of the colony. The total budget was to be in the aggregate
three thousand and twenty rix-dottan per annum. Half of
the governor's salaiy was to be in excise; the lieutenant
was to receive sixteen rix-doUara per month; the sergqmt-
oiajor, ten; the corporal, six; the gunner, eight; the trum-
peter, six; the dnimmer, five. In addition, the twenty-four
soldiers were to receive four rix-dollars each; the paymaster,
ten; the secretary, eight; the barber [surgeon], ten; the
provost, six, etc.

kept a journal of the time he spent in New Sweden* This
formed the basis of Thomas Campanius's — his grandson —
Dtscription 9f the Province of New Swtdtn, The elder Cam-
panius was bom at Stockholm on August 15, 1601, and on
Februaiy 3, 1642, was appointed by the government pastor
of the congregation in New Sweden. He held this position
for six years, after which he returned to Sweden, where he
died on September 17, 1683. Shortly after landing, Printz
began to plan the erection of his residence and the fortifica-
tions. On Tinicum Island, not far above Chester, Penn-
sylvania, he erected Fort Gothenburg and his residence.
The fort is spoken of as being "pretty strong," and the
residence, Printz Hall, as being "very handsome/* On
the same island a church was likewise erected and conse-
crated by Campanius, September 4, 1646,

Another fort, Elfsbcrg or Elsinburg, was built on the east
shore of the Delaware south of the present town of Salem,
New Jersey. Hudde says : It was usually garrisoned by
twelve men and commanded by a lieutenant. It had eight
iron and brass guns, and one potshoof." Fort Gothenburg
commanded the Dutch Fort Nassau, and Fort Elsinburg is
said to have been erected for the purpose of obliging the
Dutch vessels to lower their colors on sailing up the Dela-
ware. Certain it is that De Vries, of &lt;^Zwaanendal the
Unfortunate," was fired upon (October, 1643) as ^ sailed
up the river, and ordered to strike his colors. De Vries
describes Printz, the captain of the fort, as one "who
weighed upwards of four hundred pounds, and drank three
drinks at every meal." Hazard, however, in his Annals claims
that this man was not the governor but his relative. The
Dutch must have been ne^igent in their protection of their
rights, for they did not attempt to prevent Printz*s erecting
a fort (Fort Manayunk or Schuylkill) on an island near the
mouth of the Schuylkill, thus shutting up that river. Nor
did they prevent his building a "strong house" or "New
Fort" at Kingsessing, and a somewhat more substantial
afiair named "Korsholm" at Passayunk, in somewhat the

DUTCH AND S9FEPJSM ON THE DELAWARE 53



tame neighborhood. By the erection of these forts, the
Swedes were enabled to control the fur trade of the Schuyl-
kill — without which, as Hudde, COniiniSsioner in COBIHttlld
of Fort Nassau, claimed, the possession of Delaware River
at that point was valueless. The evidence of inefficiency
in the Dutch cause and even of traitorous conduct against
Jan Janscn^ who was in charge of the Dutch interests on
the Delaware, October 12, 1 645, accumulated to such an
extent that he was reinnMci from his position. Andreas
Hudde was appointed in his place. Jan Janscn had per-
mitted the erection of these Swedish forts and "strung
houses," although thcv were clearlv opposcu lo the Dutch
interests on the Delaware. In taci, he had even lent tlic
Swedes one of the Dutch Company's carpenters for the erec-
tion of one of the forts*— (j//^«iff Ramlt^ Acrelius.)

The real beginning of serious dispute between the Dutch
and the Swedes about the possession of the Delaware was
in the early part of 1646. In December, i645» ^7 ^ care-
lessness of a servant. Fort Gothenburg was burned, the
goods contained therein were lost, and its magazine was
blown up — ^thus weakening the Swedes. Hudde was an
entirely different man from his predecessor. He was thor-
ou^y £uthfiil to his employers. He was active and perti-
nacious, whereas Jan Jansen was lazy and wavering. He
determined to extend the Dutch influence even in the face
of Swedish forts and protests. A Captain Blancke, newlv
arrived in a sloop from Manhattan, was ordered to ascend
the Schuylkill and trade with the Indians as he had intended
doing. Printz made a formal protest and threatened to seize
the vessel ami cargo. Blancke — none too brave — thereupon
retired, icaiing loss of his property. His vessel and cargo
were his own private property, and had they been forfeited
he would have found it difficult to recover them. Hudde
himsdf made an attempt to trade with the Indums of the
Schuylkill, but was no more successful than was Bhuicke.

Hudde's next move was to follow out instructions from
Manhattan and ascend the Delaware above the falls in quest



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



of minerals. In this too, however, he was forestalled by the
Indians, who claimed that the Swedes had told them that
the Dutch from Manhattan were plotting their destruction ;
that two hundred and fifty men would be sent to kill all
the savages below the falls and erect a fort to prevent their
beinir assisted by their friends from the upper river. Then
again, on the 25th ot September (1646), Hudde purchased
land from an Indian proprietor in pursuance of instructions
from Manhattan "to purchase some land from the savages
situated on the west shore, about a mile distant from Fort
Nassau to the north." Vincent (History of Delaware) holds
that as a Dutch mile was equivaitiit to four English miles,
the land taken up must have been a part of that upon which
the city of Philadelphia now stands. No sooner had the
arms of the Dutch West India Company been erected upon
a pole than Hendrick Huyghens, the Swedish commissioner,
pulled diem down. This, of course, brought vigorous pro-
tests from Hudde, with counter ones from Printz. Hudde's
last protest was sent by a sergeant on October 22d, but
Printz is said to have received the protest most contemptu-
ously and had the serg^t thrown out of doors with still
less ceremony.

The quarrel between the two little colonies grew warmer
and warmer. An abortive attack of the Indians upon the
Dutch was credited by Hudde to the diabolical machina-
tions of the Swedes. "Printz," said he, "leaves nothincr
untried to render the Dutch suspected by both savages and
Christians.** Likewise, when Hudde asserted the priority
of the Dutch claim to the Delaware, Printz replied "that
the devil was the oldest possessor of hell, but thai he soiiie-
times admitted a younger one." In addition, Printz was
accused of further tampering with tihe Minqua Indians-^
furnishing them with guns and powder. He stopped the
Dutch vessel £r/ir, confiscated a quantity of powder and
shot, and committed other less belligerent acts.

Right in the duck of the quarrel, however, a man became
Director-general of New Netherland, in place of Kieft, who

DUTCH AND SWEDISH ON THE DELAWAKE 55



could out-bluster Printz and whose bluster was accom-
panied by deeds to the extent made possible by his very

limited possession of the sinews of war. Peter Stuyvesant
arrived at New Amsterdam on the nth of May, 1647, and
began his administration six days later. He it was who

was to change the balance of power on the Delaware as
between the Dutch and the Swedes by throwing his per-
sonality into the scale. Stuyvesant moved oiutiously at first
and almost diplomatically, which is saying a great deal in

his case. But move he did, and the manner of that move-
ment and the causes leading up to it will be the subjects
under consideration in a subsequent chapter.

CHAPTER III



CLASH OF NJnONAUTIES ON THE DELAIfARE^ 1621-1647

Thk early struggle for the possession of the Delaware
was a thrt I -cornerf-d one. The Dutch, the Swedes, and
the Enei "^li vvtTc the contestants, and the claims of each
may be defended with a certain show of historical justice.
There is no doubt as to the mere historical fact-i;. But
when it comes to an estimate of the evidence, ditiiculty is
experienced at once. It is easy enough to say that dis-
coveries were made by John and Sebastian Cabot (1498),
by Verrazano (1524), by Sir Humphrey Gilbert (1583), by
Henry Hudson (i6oq), and that thcv inrhulcd the terri-
tories under consideration. It is just as c:asy to assert that
the same territories were a part of the London and Plymouth
grants (1606), the patent of the Council for New England
(1620), the Maryland giant to Lord Baltimore (1632),
die Palatine grant of New Albion (1634), the old Dutch
monopoly of 1 614, the grant to the Dutch West India
Company (1621), the grant to Lord Lennox and Lord Mul-
grave on the dissolution of the Council for New England
(^^35)) tlic grant to the Swedish West India Company.
But it is quite a different matter to decide as to the merits of
each case from the point of view of actual historical right
to sovereignty. The relative merits of "first discovery,"
"earliest settlement," "bona fide purchase," "actual de-
velopment," must be determined in the conflicting claims
before a useful expression of opinion can be given. Even

57

further difficulty will be experienced on account of the abso-
lute want of deiiniteness of boundaries in the old chaners,
patents, grants, and deeds. European geography was sadly
enough neglected, but in the case of the New World there
was an almost total absence of anything approaching geo-
graphical accuracy in the difieient charters and patents even
in those parts where discoveiy and exploration would seem
to have furnished the necessary materials. Monarchs gave
charters right and left, not only without a due regard for
the chirns of other nations, but seemingly even without a
due regard for the territorial boundaries of grants already
given by themselves. Consequently, we have not only the
conflicting territorial claims of friendly or hostile monarchs,
but even the spectacle of threatened hostilities between the
rtprt srntatives of the same monarch by reason of their
claiming the same territory and having their claims backed
up by formal patents. For example, not only did the Swedes
and the Dutch come to blows over their respective claims
to the Delaware, but William Penn and Lord Baltimore,
some years hitcr, almost came lo blows over pans of the
same territory. Even at the time when the Swedes and
the Dutch fought over the possession of the Delaware, they
both combined to drive the English out of the same terri-
tory} while the English, on their part, quarrelled among
themselves as to which of their own patents properly covered
the disputed territory. The Virginians claimed it to be a
part of their grant; Lord Baltimore asserted his proprietor-
ship over it; the English of New Haven and Boston actu-
ally tried to colonize it; while Sir Edmund Plowden, calling
himself Earl Palatine of New Albion, tried to drive the
Dutch and Swedes from the same territory, for he con-
sidered it a part of his dominions granted by Charles I.

The truth of the matter is that something more than
right of first discovery, priority of grant, charter, or patent,
and even than right of first occupancy, should constitute the
most substantial claim to ownership and sovereignty. To
be sure, these claims to ownership should have their due

CLASH OF NATIONAUriES ON THE DELAWARE 59



weight, but in themselves merely they are not sufficient.
The real test is actual occupation of tlie territory with the
intention permanently to develop the territory as occupied
and some degree of evidence that that intention is being ful-
filled. Sebastian Cabot may have sailed along the coast of
America as far south as Cape Hatteras in 1498, and may
even have sailed into New York Bay, but that fact did not
give England a just claim to the Hudson and the Delaware as
against the claim of the Dutch. Venazano no doubt sailed
into New York Bay in 1524, and coasted along the con-
tinent to the south, but that fact did not give his master
Francis I. a just claim to the Delaware and the Hudson for
France as against either the Dutch or English claim. And
what is more to the point, although there is no doubting the
importance of Henry Hudson's sailing up North River in
1609 as iar as the Albany of to-day, yet that discovery,
remforced as it was by the later explorations of Block and
May, did not give the Dutch an undisputed title to the
lands explored. If the Dutch claim to the possession of
New Netherland had been based upon nothing more sub-
stantial than that discoverv, then it could not be supported
as against the English claim.

The Delaware of the Swedes and the Dutch occupied
that neutral bck of territory between the two branches of the
great joint stock company chartered by James 1. in 1606,
and known as the London and Plymouth Companies from
the city headquarters of their management. The London
Company had jurisdiction from tfauty-four to thirty-eight
degrees north latitude; the Plymouth Company, from forty-
live down to forty-one degrees. The provision was made
that the intervening territoiy between thirt) -eight and forty-
one degrees was to go to whichever company should first
plant a self-supporting colony. Now, the Swedish and
Dutch settlements upon the Delaware were made entirely
within this neutral belt. Consequently, when from twenty-
three to thirty-two years after this grant was made the Dutch
and Swedes permanently located themselves on the Delaware,



Digiii^cu by Gdo^Ic



6o MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



they did so within territory already claimed and allotted by
the English, The English, however, made no attempts at
settlement on the river during this period.

A part of this territory was likewise included in the new
charter granted to the London or Virginia Company in
1609, when the old charter's bounds were made to comprise
the coast line two hundred miles north and two hundred
miles south of Point Comfort. Furthermore, reference has
been made to the fact that in 161 3 when Captain Argall,
of Virginia, was returning from a predatory visit to the
French settlement at Port Royal in Acadia, he stopped at
Manhattan. He claimed that a grant of land there had been
made him by the Virginia Company. He forced Christian-
sen, representing the Dutch power, to recognize the sover-
eignty of the King of England and the authority of the
Governor of Virginia, and to agree to the payment of tribute
in recognition of his dependence on the English crown.

In 1 62 1, as we have seen, through representations of the
V^irginia Companv, the English Privy Council instructed its
ambassador at I he Hague, Sir Dudley Carleton, to protest
against the Dutch occupancy of the Hudson and Delaware
valleys. In these instructions, dated December 15, 162 1,
the English claimed the territory in quest idii jure prtrn^
ocfupationis. The remonstrance was delivered to the States
General the following year, but nothing came of it.

On June 20, 1632, Charles I. granted a charter to Cecilius
Calvert, Lord Baltimore, in recognition of George Calvert's
services to James l.\ but more particularly, probably, through
the intercession of his Catholic queen, Henrietu Maria,
who was interested in securing a home for the persecuted
followers of her faith. The boundaries of this grant were
well defined* Its limits were to the fortieth parallel of
north lautude and on the south to the southern border
of what is now Delaware. The eastern boundary was the
ocean and Delaware Bay and River. This, of course,
embraced all the present State of Delaware and a part
of Pennsylvania.

The English cUum to the Delaware asserted anew
in 1633, when De Vries visited Vifj^nia to obtain com. He

was given a cordial welcome, but was told at the same time
that South River belonged to the English, and it was added)
though enoneously, chat Lord Delaware had taken posses-
sion of it some years ago.

On June 21,1634, Charles I. granted to Sir Edmund
Plowden and eight other petitioners all Long Island and
forty leagues square of the adinining continent. 1 his was
the Count V Palatine of New Albion. The charter was so
defined as to include not only New Jersey, but also Mary-
land, Delaware, and i^ennsylvania. The eastern side of
the "-^ fortv leairues square" extended along the coast from
Sandy Huuk to Cape May. Sir Edmund, the earl of tluii
county palatine, made futile attempts until the day of his
death, in 1659, to wrest his earldom from the unsympathetic
Swedes and Dutch then fiimlj settled on the Dehware. It
should be mentioned that Vincent (Histmj of Delaufore^
142) holds that this grant did not include Delaware, but
appertained exclusively to New Jersey.

Peter Minuit, called at Jamestown, Virginia. This afforded
the En^sh another opportunity to assert their claim to the
Delaware. In a ktter to Secretary Windebanke, dated
May 8, 163$, Jerome Hawley, the secretary of Virginia,
described in some detail the visit of the Swedes. He men-
tioned their determination to make a settlement on the
Delaware under a commission from the young (^een of
Sweden. At the close of the letter, he reasserted the Eng-
lish claim to the Delaware. He likewise suggested that
the Swedes and others might be prevented from scuiaig
on the Delaware by the English colonists in Virginia and
by the use of visiting English ships — certainly without any
^charges upon his majesty." During this whole period
there is only one instance recorded when the English are
said to have relinquished their claim to the Delaware.



62 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



About 1632, Charles I., upon application of the Swedish
ambassador, John Oxenstiern, is s iil to have relinquished
to the Swedes all claims to the Delaware, i his recognition
of the Swedish claim was said to have been by reason of the
riglK of iint diicoveiy . There is no evidence of a document-
aiy character to support this agreement It is little or nothing
more than tradition. Acrelius mentions the circumstance,
but assigns a Uter date to it. Therefore, it may be said
with approximate historical exactness that firom the bea-
ding of exploration in the Hudson and Delaware valleys to
the overthrow of New Netherland there was not a time
when the English did not assert their claim to the territory
in question. As to the justice of their claim, that is another
matter: it was based upon right of first discovery; and what-
ever may be said as to its merits, there can be no difFerence «
of opinion as to the continuous assertion of it in the most
positive terms. Attempts of other nations to establish colo-
nies in the two valleys were m variably subjects of protest by
the English.

We have already seen that the boundaries of New
Netherland were defined by the Dutch in 1614. That
the southern Imut was South River, or the Delaware, and
the northern limit the forty-fifth parallel. We have like-
wise noted the failure of the first two Dutch attempts at
colonization upon the Delaware — ^Fort Nassau in 1623, and
Zwaanendal in 1631* And we have seen, furthermore, that
it was not until 1638 that the first Swedhh settlement was
made at Fort Christina.

From this survey it is perfectly clear that from the point
of view of " right of discovery*' and Apriority of claim" the
English had a decided advantage over the Dutch. And,
moreover, that from both those points of view and, in addi-
tion, priority of occupancy," the Dutch had an indisputa-
bly clearer title to the territory than had the Swedes. The
latter were clearly interlopers, although at first possibly
innocent ones. As between the Fn&lt;»^lish and Dutch claims,
the advantage is undoubtedly with the latter. Although the

English claim to first discovery and priority of claim is with-
out question^ yet it was the Dutch who first took actual
possession of the territory in dispute. The English made
no serious attempts to colonize the Delaware until the un-
fortunate intrusion of the New Haven company at Varkin*s
Kill and Passayunk in 164 1. It was not until the Dutch
had shown the value of the territory from the point of view
of the fur trade that the Swedes came and the English of
Virginia and New England hegan to turn a covetous eye
toward those parts. It was the coming of the English that
practically precipitated the triangular clash on the Delaware.

The New England claim included all the territory between
forty and forty-eight degrees of north latitude. Roughly
speaking, this extended from about the latitude of Philadel-
phia to near the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Lord Balti-
more's claim extended from the thirty-eighth to the fortieth
degree of north latitude. This shut out the Dutch and
Swedes completely.

As early as 1642 the Director-general and Council of
New Netherland, learnmg of the English settlements on the
Delaware opposite Fort Nassau and on the Schuylkill, tooic
definite action having in view their expulsion. The settle-
ments were considered of "ominous consequence, disre-
spectful to tlieir High Mightinesses, and injurious to the
interests of the West India Company, as by it their com-
merce on the South River might be eventually ruined." In
view of these facts, it was resolved »that it is our duty to
drive these English from thence, in the hest manner pos-
sible.'* Accordingly, April 22d, instrucdons were issued
to Jan Jansen, commissary or governor on the Delaware.
Upon the arrival of the yachts Real and St, Martin he was
to proceed to the Schuylkill with a body of men and require
the English to show their authority for daring to encroach
upon **the Dutch rights and privileges, territory, and com-
merce." On fiiilure to show the proper authority, the Eng-
lish were to be driven away as peaceably as possible. Should
they make a show of resistance, they were to be secured and

brought to New Amsterdam. The English improvements
were to be levelled ^on the spot," but care was to be had
that no personal property was injured. An accurate inven-
tory of the personal property was to be taken in the presence
of the English.

Jan Jansen undoubtedly carried out his instructions and
expelled the English from the Schuylkill. The New Haven
records declare that in spite of the English purchases on
both sides of the river, Governor Kieft sent armed men
without warning or protest and forcibly burned the trading
house. Furthermore, that their goods were seized and held
for a while and that they themselves were kept prisoners.
The damage done was estimated at ;^ioo, for which no
satisfaction could be secured as late as 1650.

As we have seen, no sooner had Printz become settled
as governor of the Swedish colony than he proceeded to
expel the culonibis of New Haven under Lamberton from
their remaining settlements upon the Delaware. Testimony
to this etfect was given before the court of New Haven
(August 2, 1643) by John Thtckpciiny, one of the colo-
nists who had been a.rrci)ted with Lamberton. According to
Thickpcnny's deposition, this expulsion of the English from
Varkin*s Kill was not unaccompanied with treachery. While
Lamberton's pinnace, the Cock^ was anchored about three
miles above Fort Elsinburg, a letter arrived from Printz.
The letter was brought by two Swedes, Tim the barber
[surgeon] and Godfrey the merchant's man, Printz stated
that the Indians had stolen a gold chain from his wife.
That, as those Indians were about to trade with Lamber-
ton, he desired his good offices in getting the chain back.
Lamberton was requested to stay on board until the next
morning, when he would fecognize the thief by a certain
mark on his face. No Indians came aboard. But when
Lamberton called upon Printz at the tatter's request, in
company with John Woollen, the Indian interpreter, and
John Thickpenny, all three were arrested. Woollen was
placed in irons. Printz's wife and Tim the barber tried

to get Woollen intoxicated. He was given all the wine
and beer he could drink — no mean quantity — and imme-
diately taken before Printz. That worthy made great pro*
fcssions of love for VV oollen and " made large promises to
do him good.'* l^his was done with the obirct in view of
persuading Wooilen to say " that George Lamberton had
hired the Indians to cut off the Swedes." Woollen refused
to make the statement, Printz- then "drank to him again,"
and said "he would make him a man, p:ive him a planta-
tion, and build him a house, and that he wuuld not want for
gold and silver.** Woollen again refused. The governor
became much enraged, swore vigorously, and, clapping the
iroiit upon Woollen, threw him into prison.

Lamberton Bnallj reguned his liberty by paying Prints
a weight of beaver." All the English who refiued to
take the oath of allegiance to the crown of SMreden were
expelled. Lamberton reported these outrages to the court
of New Haven. The court requested Governor Winthrop
to demand satisfaction of both the Dutch and Swedish gov-
ernments. Lamberton was commissioned to treat with the
Swedish government about reparation for the losses sus-
tained. This he did not succeed in doing, however, for in
1647, while on a voyage to England, he was lost at sea.

Governor Winthrop carried out the instructions of the
New Haven court. He wrote Printz with reference to his
treatment of Lamberton. Printz denied the whole mattf-r,
"using at the same time large expres!si{&gt;ns " of his rcsj)cct
for the English and particularly for the Nrw Haven colony.
He took occasion at the same time to forward copies, on
oath, of the examinations taken in the case and also a copy
of all the proceedings between the Swedes and the New
Haven colonists settled on the Delaware. Winthrop laid
these documents before the General Court of the United
Cdlonies of New Enghnd. The court met at Boston on
the 7th of March and had cognizance of just such disputes.
Printz requested to be shown a copy of the New England
patent. It was reported that he said he would allow the

English to proceed with their settlement on the Delaware
shoulil a new commission be given them by the commis*
sioners of the United Colonies. The conmussion was
issued.

The next incident in these petty international disputes
was more vexatious than serious. An expedition had been
sent from Boston in 1644 to discover the great Lake Ly-
connia. It was supposed to lie in the northwest of the land
included in the New England patent, and might be reached
by sailing up the Delaware. The ultimate object was the
development of a new trade in beavers. The expedition
was well provisioned and well htted tor exploration pur-
poses. Letters were carried to Printz, the Swedish governor,
and Jan Jansen, the Dutch governor, on the Delaware.
The Dutch allowed the expedition to proceed, but at the
same time made a protest as a matter of record. On the
other hand, tlic Swctiish tort brought them to by a shot trom
a cannon. William Aspinwall, the leader of the expedition,
landed and remonstrated with the Swedish governor for
having treated him so badly. The latter acknowledged his
fault and promised amends. The amends turned out to be
of the nature of a bill for forty shillings — the price of the
shot fired at them. The bill was paid. Both the Dutch
and Swedish governors now allowed the expedition to pro-
ceed. Neither, however, permitted the English to engage in
trade, even going so far as to appoint a pinnace each to
attend them. The master of the English vessel proved
" such a drunken sot, and so complied with the Dutch and
Swedes, that they feared that when they had left the vessel to
have o^one up the lake in a small boat, he in his drunkenness
would hav^e betrayed their goods to the Dutch." Fearing
such treachery, the adventurers gave up the expedition and
returned home. A second similar expedition from Boston
fared more disastrously. After having secured a supply of
beaver, they were suddenly attacked by the Indians. The
master and three others were killed. A man and a boy were
capLuicd. Tile toiaier, Redman by name, i^^iiew the Indian

hngiMige and lived among the Indians for over a month. He
received a part of the stolen goods. Printz persuaded certain
Indians to capture him, and when he was taken they sent him
on to Boston. He was tried for betraying his companions,

but was acquitted.

Governor Eaton, of New H?.ven, complained londlv of
the outrages suffered by the English on the Delaware at the
hands of the Dutch and Swedes. He addressed a letter to
GoveriKH Kieft at Manhattan, dated AiiL^ust 12, 1646, em-
bodviiii: these complaints. The distance from New Haven
to Manhattan seems to have deadened the sound of his
" yammering "i at least, in so far as the Dutch attention to
them is a true test of their audibility. The protests were
made, but the Dutch gave no proofs by their acts of having
heard them.

In 1^)49 and 1630, duriiig the adrauiistration o{ Peter
Stuy V csant, this quarrel between the Dutch and the English
of New Haven reached a climax. Governor Eaton, of New
Haven, complained to the Commissioners of the Unite4
Colonies of New England at their meeting in Boston in
1649. commisaioners, however, were not very favor-
ably disposed toward the New Haven attempt to colonize
the Delawaie. They held that the plantations in New
England were already veiy much undermanned, and that
consequently the men for colonization purposes could not
be spared. Nevertheless, thev addressed a letter to Stuyve-
sant, stating that previous replies of the Dutch authorities .at
Manhattan to the commissioners' complaints relative to the
outrages upon the Dehwaie had not been at all satisfac-
tory. Furthermore, they asserted the right of the English
to the tracts on the Delaware, and that whilst the people of
New Haven would neither encroach nor In any way disturb
the peace of the Dutch, they must not iiul in maintaining the
rights and interests of the English."

At this point, Stuyvesant proved himself to be a diplomat
such as hardly anyone gives him the credit of being. He
agreed to meet the Commissioners of the United Colonies



68 MIDDLE STATES AND MAKYLAHD



at Hartford for the purpose of arranging amicably the diffi-
culties about the settlement of the Delaware. The meeting
was held at the request of the commissioners. A short
account of this very interesting event will not be out of
place.

Stuyvesant reached Hartford on the 23d of September^
1650, after a four davs* journey. He travelled in great
state and was courteously received along the entire route.
The negotiatiufis were carried on in writing, in order "that
all inconvenience by verbal speaking either through hasti-
ness or otherwise" might be prevented. A number of
important questions in dispute were settled at once. Other
questions were left for arbitration. Two arbitration com-
missioners were apptjiiited by each party. The United
Colonies appointed Simon Bradstreet, of Massachusetts Bay
Colony, and Thomas Prince, of Plymouth Colony. Stuy-
vesant selected Capuin Thomas Willett^ a merchant of
Plymouth, and Ensign George Baxter, his English secre-
taiy. Stuyvesant's instructions to his representatives were
exceedingly liberal. The four points submitted to the con-
sideration of the arbitrators were: &lt;^ first, the settlement of
diflferences; secondly, a provisional boundary between the
English and the Dutch; thirdly, a course to be pursued con-
cerning fugitives ; fourthly, a neighborly union between New
England and New Netherland, as near as may be agreed
upon." In substance, they had full power to settle "any
differences between the two nations/' to end and determine
them as they might deem just and right." Likewise, they
were clothed "with power to enter into such terms of accord
for provisional limits and leagues of love and union betwixt
the two nations in those parts as to them should seem just
and right." Similar instructions were given to the arbitrators
of the United Colonics.

When the arbitrators met, the New Haven grievances
were presented to them. Stuvvesant was not prepared to
reply to the chari'-es made, by reason of the fact that the
alleged outrages had been committed during the incumbency



CLASH OF NATIOMAUriES ON THE DELAIVAKM 69



of his predecessor, Kieft, Consequently, the aibiLraturs sus-
pended judgment on those grievances in order to afford
Stuyvesant time to lay the matter before the West India
Company so that due reparation might be made» Never-
theless, Stuyvesant did not weaken in the slightest degree
the claim of the Dutch to the DeUiware, On the contnuy,
he continued to protest most vigorously against any other
claim. Neither of the claimants would abate one jot from
its original claims. The arbttrators, therefore, finding no
basis for a just settlement or for even a satisfactory com-
promise of the dispute, decided to make a thoroughly color-
less award. Both parties were to remain in statu quo prius.
They were to " plead and improve their just interests on the
Delaware for planting and trading as they shall see cause;"
but that "ail proceedings there, as in other places, were to
be carried on in love and peace," till the right might be
"further considered and greatly issued cither in Europe or
here by the two. states of England and Holland." The
award, of course, settled nothnig as tu the possession of the "
Delaware. Nevertheless, it was duly signed on September
19, 1650, by the arbitrators in the presence of all of the
commissioners. Stuyvesant agreed to abide by the decision.

The absence of clashes between the Dutch and the Eng-
lish upon the Delaware for several months led Stuyvesant
into the belief that his Hartford treaty had proved a success. .
If he ever indulged such a thought, he was rather rudely
shaken in the possession of it, for the appetite of the New
Haven people for the rich and fertile banks of the Delaware
had merely been whetted by their brief occupation of them.
Fifty citizens of that colony embarked in a ch&amp;rtered vessel
under a commission from Governor Eaton and sailed for
the Delaware. They touched at New Amsterdam and
presented letters to Stuyvesant. The director-general was
taken completely by surprise upon learning their destina-
tion. He asked to see their commission, and upon receiving
it declined to return it. The master of the vessel and four
others were arrested, thrown into prison, and kept there until

MIDDLE STATES AUD MARYLAND



they pledged themselves to abandoo their expedition and
return home* Stuyvesant took occasion at the same time
to warn them that if he should find them trading on the
Delaware, their goods would be seized and themselves sent
prisoners to Holland. He also wrote to Governor Eaton,
April I X, 1 65 1 , protesting in very strong language against the
infraction of the provisional agreement. To emphasize his
determination to preserve the Dutch ri^ts on the Delaware
intact, he declared that he would oppose all intruders ^ with
force of arms and martial opposition, even unto bloodshed."

The prospective colonists considered themselves badly
used by Stuyvesant. They promptly complained to the
Commissioners of the United Colonies at their next meeting,
stating their pecuniary loss to have been ;£'300. In addi-
tion, they demanded satisfaction for their imprisonment as
well as protection in the settlement of the lands they claimed
as justly theirs.

The commissioners were very cautious. They did not
think it advisable to precipitate hostilities, at least for the
time being. To mollify the injured New Haven colonists,
however, the commissioners decided that if they should fit
out an expedition of from one hundred to one hundred and
fiftv men nt their own expense, the United Colonies would
protect them from the Dutch. The conditions imposed,
however, were so very onerous that one gets the impres-
sion that the commissioners did not expect the New Haven
people to comply with them. The expedition must be under-
taken within twelve months; it was to be made up of able-
bodied men, fully equipped with arms and ammunition and
transported in vessels "fit for such an enterprise j" finally,
the whole expedition must he approved in all its details
by the magistrates of New Haven. Then, aticr all the re-
quirements had been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the com-
missioners, if they "carried themselves peaceably,*' the
United Colonies would furnish them with a sufficient num-
ber of soldiers for their defence. They were to bear the
whole expense, however, of such protection, and their lands

and other property were to be held as surety for the
payment of the debt.

The representations made to Stuyvesant were of far
greater importance. He was informed that he had broken
the Hartford treaty, which permitted the English colonists
to settle on their Delaware lands. Furthermore, that he
had shown ^no just title to the Delaware/' and was in no
position, consequently, to dictate who should settle there.
At the same time, they wrote to their London agent,
Mr. E(i\vard Winslow, complaining of the conduct of the
Dutch :irul of the dishonor placed upon the EngHsh nation
by submitting to such outrages. They pointed out also
the duty of preserving the En2:li?h title to so considerable a
place as Delaware. They claimed that the Dutch should
be compelled to pay damages to those who had suffered
injuries in person and estate. The commissioners disclosed
a certain degree of uncertainty in their own minds as to
the validity of their title to the Delaware. They were not
quite sure that their neglect to improve the Delaware lands
had not invalidated Llieir title to those lands. l o satisfy
themselves on this point, the commissioners directed their
agent to learn how Parliament or the Council of State
regarded thdr claim to the knds under old patents when
those lands had not been improved. They were desirous
of knowing, likewise, if Parliament had made any later
grants of those lands, and, if so, whether the rights of bona
fide purchasers under the old patents had been regarded.

The people of New Haven were persistent in their deter-
mination to maintain their rights on the Delaware. They
went so hx as to ask Captain Mason, a man of ^ known
courage and military skill," to remove with them to the
Delaware and take the management of the Company. He
was upon the point of accepting when the General Court
of Connecticut unanimously requested him to remain at
home, inasmuch as his services were deemed indispensable.
He yielded to the wishes of the General Court, and the
project was abandoned.

It was two years before the £ng^th of New Haven or

the United Colonies ag^in made a serious move in the direc*
tion of the Delaware. In April, 1 653, at the request of
Stuyvesant, the £nglish appointed three commissionert to

repair to Manhattan. They were to discuss more particu-
larly immediate New £ngland and New Netheriand diA*
cutties } yet matters concerning Delaware River were not
to be overlooked entirely. Inasmuch as this conference
concerns the wider interests of New Netheriand, a fuller
account of it will be given in a subsequent chapter. It is
of interest to u«; at this point as being an important incident
in the course of events leading; up to the hnal contest be-
tween the Dutch and the Knglish for the possession of the
Hudson and Delaware River vallevs. This conference was
not attended with much success. For some cause, the com-
missioners left Manhattan in haste, greatly to the surprise of
Stuyvesant. In their letter to Governor Stuyvesant, May 2,
165"^, the c&lt;jmmii»sioners reiterated all their previous com-
plaints. I'hey said "that to this day they have received
nothing but dilatory cxreptij)ns, oflVnsive affronts, and un-
pleasant answers, as well in the South River Bav, called Dela-
ware, as upon the Fresh River, called Connecticut." In
answer t{) this arraignment, Stuyvesant addressed a long letter
to the court at Boston, in which he completely unmasked.
He said," the question is under whose jurisdiction were these
lands on South River before they were bought, built, and
inhabitated" by the New Haven colonists? Furthermore,
that his refusal to permit the English to settle on the Dela^
ware was in strict accoidance with his express orders. Thus
his whole treatment of the last New Haven expedition was
proper in eveiy respect and, in truth, even courteous. That,
hi from throwing the messengers of the expedition into
prison, he had had them entertained most civilly indeed at
the house of Martin Cryg^, the captain-lieutenant of the
town.

CHAPTER IV

MJINTSNJNCB OF THE STATUS ^PO

The reader will no doubt wonder why at some time
prior to 1655 during the continuance of this triangular clash
between the Dutch, the Swedes, and the English for the
possession of the Delaware, open and actual hostilities did
not break out ^ Why the Dutch of New Nctheriand, who
wtrt- much stronger than the Swedes of New Sweden, did
not declare war upon the latter and exterminate them?
This they could have done with the greatest ease at any
time prior to the actual overthrow of New Sweden by Stuy-
vesant in 1655. '"'^y a«;kcd, why did not the

English declare war against New Nctheriand? The English
on the North American continent far outclassed the Dutch
in population, wealth, aiul \n the Ntal»ilit\ ot their settle-
ments. New Nctheriand was complcu lv hedged in by
the English of New England, of V'irginia, and of Maryland.
Not only was this true, but many English colonists had
settled in the territory immediately bordering upon the
Dutch letdcments. This territoiy was in most instances
acknowledged to be Dutch territoiy. For instance, we find
the £n^sh settled all along the northern shore of Long
Ishmd and along the southwestern coast of what is now
Connecticttt, but what was then regarded as Dutch terri-^^
toiy. Not only was this so, but we find the population of
New Necherland itself containing such a large percentage
of English settleri, that from veiy early times Kieft, then
Director-geneial of New Netherhmd, found it absolutely

75

^6 MIDDLE STATES AND MAKTUND

necessary to create an English secretaryship as one of the
colonial offices. In brief, we may say that New Nether-
land was not only hedged about by the ubiquitous English
but was thoroughly honeycombed by them.

There was no time from the beginning of the trouble
between the Dutch and the English in America when the
English of the United Colonies alone could not have anni'
hilated the little Dutch colony. Then why, we may ask again,
did not England conquer the Dutch and the Swedish colo-
nies when so many excellent causes of hostilities presented
themselves continuously — the Lamberton affair and the
arrest of the messengers of the New Haven expedition at
New Amsterdam, for instance? Or, at least, why did not
the Dutch take advantage of their numerous opportunities
to open hostilities with the Swedes — the insult to the Dutch
arms and Printz's treatment of the Dutch upon the Dela-
ware being cases in point? But neither the English nor
the Dutch took advantage of their superior pb \ sic.il powers
to crush wantonly a weaker colony. We must look for the
explanation in the politics of both Eufopc -Awd America,
^ Stuyvesant sums up \ cry aj)tly some of the most important
reasons in his correspondence with Governor Winthrop.

When the quarrel between the Dutch and the New
Haven people concerning the occupation of the Delaware
by the latter was rapidly reaching a critical pointy Governor
Winthrop took occasion to address a letter to Peter Stuy-
vesant. He expressed his regret at the misunderstanding
which existed between the latter and Governor Eaton. He
also expressed his desire that all further provocation on
either side be avoided. Stuyvesant gave immediate attention
to this communication from a gentleman whose personal
worth and integrity secured him universal respect.*' In
his reply under date of April 3, 1648, he took occasion
to defend his reputation from the scandalous attacks of
the New Haven people. He said he had been greatly
wounded in reputation by those reports which taxed him
with attempting to raise the Mohawks against the English.

It was contnuy to the nilct tnd pciiiciplet of ChriftmiH
eren to entertim to ^^devilith and wicked t device,"
much ksB to put it in practice. While at Foft Orange,
be had endeavored to eitabliih, (according to hit bounden

tween the Mohawks and all the other Indian tribes and the
Dutch, but also between those and "his brethren the Eng-
lish and French*" Thit^ he held, proved the sincerity of
bis profesaions at againtt the slanders of Mr. Winthrop'a
countrymen. Furthermore, "for Christianity's sake, for
love and union," he was willing to overlook these wrongs
and wns ready to support Governor VVinthrop in anything
he might consider expedient for a union in the bonds of
Christian love and fricndiv nriahborhood."

In a second coninii nication, dated May 24th, he renewed
his offer to meet in Connecticut, at an earU day, the gov-
ernors of Massachusetts Bay and New Plymouth colonies
and the Commissioners of the United Colonies. The pur-
pose of the meeting, he stated, to be "to reconcile the pasi,
to prevent future differences j and to establish a joint league,
offensive and defensive." The necessity of the "joint ,
league'* be urged on the grounds of: ^^first, tbeir unitjr
of faith j secondly, the ancient and loving union between
both nations in Europe; thirdly, their common dangers
horn tbetr common enemies; fourthly, the known malice
of the barbarians to both the Dutch and English,"

In this correspondence Stuyresant gives us what might
be called a summary of the reasons why open hostilities
had not broken out between the English and the Dutch and,
we m^k add, the Swedes in America. A brief review of
the intemationai rektions of these three nations during the
century intervening between the accession of Philip II. to
the throne of Spain (1556) and the passage of the £lng-
lish Navigation Acts in 165 1 will show the sig^cance of
Stuvvesant*s statements.

First, as to their "unity of faith." By the end of the
first quarter of the sixteenth century. Protestantism had been

introduced Into all three nations. In England, the Refoima-
tton mav be nid to have commenced with the divorce of
Henry VIII. from Catharine of Angon, his marriage to Anne

Boleyn (1533), and the consequent rupture with Rome^
The Reformation was checked temporarily by the passage
of the bill of the Six Articles in 1539, but was practically
completed during the reign of Edward VL (1547—1553).
Then came the restoration of Romanism in the reign of
Mary Tudor (l 553—1558) and the subsequent recovery
of Protestantism in the reign of Elizabeth (i 558-1 603).
T*he Act of Supremacy (1559), the growth of Puritanism,
and the Spanish Armada (1588), definitely fixed England in
her Protestantism before the end of Elizabeth's reign. Cer-
tainly from the beginning of the English successful coloniza-
tion of America (1607), and throu^out the colonial period.
Protestantism may be said to have been the paramount faith
in England. Particularly is this true of the period imme-
diately under discussion (1623-1655), which includes the
greater part of the period of Puritan supremacy* There
was, of course, the reactionary tendency toward Roman
Catholicism in the reign of Charles IL, and more particu-
larly in that of James II, The second revolution, the placing
of William and Mary on the throne, and the Act of Settle-
ment (1701), gave to Protestantism its certain status. The
accession of the Protestant Hanoverians (17 14) completed
the mo^ ement.

The doctrines of Luther found an easy entrance into the
Provinces, from 1521 to 1555, they were brought in by
foreign merchants, "together with whose commodities/*
writes the old Jesuit historian Strada, "this plague often
sails." The German and Swiss soldiers whom Charles V.
brought to the country j the English exiles, driven away by
the persecutions of Mary Tudor; the proximity of the
Provinces to Germany and France; the sphrit and occupa-
tion of the pc o^&gt;]c ; and, in fact, the whole atmosphere of
the country — all combined to make easy the introduction
of Protestantism into the Provinces. The Inquisition, Alva's

atrocities, anil the schemings of Philip IL, not only failed
to extirpate Protestantism from the Netherlands but caused
it to take still deeper root* The declaration of Dutch
Independence was formally issued at The Hague on the
26th of Jul/) 15^^) ^nd was followed by the great pros-
perity of the United Provinces. At length, April 9, 1609,
a truce for twelve years was agreed to between the Dutch
■Republic and Spain. The former's freedom and inde-
pendence were unconditionally recognized. There were no
conditions concerning religion. Thus, at the beginning of
Dutch colonization in America, Protestantism was firmly
established in Holland. The end of the twelve years' truce
brought on war, but the supremacy of the Protestant faith
was never threatened for a moment in the Netherlands.
The final negotiations of peace between Spain and the
United Provinces toolc place in 1648 and were followed
shortly by the prosperity and preeminence of the Dutch
Republic.

Luther's doctrines were first introduced into Sweden in
1519, by two brothers, Olaus and Laurentius Petri, who had
studied under the "great apostle of reform "at Wittenberg.
Through the Petris, Gustavus Vasa entered into a corre-
spondence with Luther, and at the ereat Diet at Westerns
in 1527 the Reformation was formally inirotluced. There
were several reactions in Sweden toward Roman Catholi-
cism, — especially during the reign of John III. (i 568-1 592),
— but in every instance the reaction was in connection with
the prospective union with Poland. The accession of Gus&lt;&gt;
tavus Adolphus, in 161 1, assured the firm establishment of
Protestantism in Sweden.

This review of ecclesiastical conditions in England, Hol-
land, and Sweden during the period of the rivaliy of the
three nations for the possession of the Delaware and Hud-
son valleys emphasizes the importance of Stuyvesant's first
reason for the necessity of peace and union. It may be
held very justly, however, that it was not so much unity
of faith" that made these nations tolerant of each other as



8o



MIDDIS STATES JND MARrUND



it was unity in their opposition to Rome. En^and was
first Episcopalian, then Presbyterian or Calvinistic, and again
Episcopalian; while Holland was Cdvinistic and Arminian,
and Sweden was laigply Lutheran. At times there was
almost as much hostility between the different Protestant
sects as between those same sects and Roman Catholicism*
It was their mutual dislike of Rome that united them.

This unity of faith" or unity of opposition to Roman
Catholicism brought forward the second argument of Stuy-
vesant for peace and union, namely^ ^^the ancient and
loving union" between these nations in Europe. During
the period of which we are treating, England, Holland, and
Sweden had been for the most part either in open military
. alliance against Spain and the Empire or had secretly ren-
dered each other assistance. From 1623 to 1651, at least
the people of the several countries sympathized at all times
with tlu struggles of the others for religious freedom and
ecclesiastical independence.

The policies of the Dutch and Swedish colonial governors
were outlmed and dictated from Europe. These policies
were governed almost entirely by the political and economic
conditions existing in Europe. The same cannot be said so
truly of the English colonial governments. New England
always acted more or less independently of the home govern-
ment. This at first was attributable to a want of interest
on the part of the latter. Later, however, it was due to
the great English revolution and the unsettled condition of
English politics. The English colonies were left largely to
shift for themselves. Nevertheless, in international affairs
— ^in matters of importance between them and their neigh-
bors of foreign nationality — the colonial governments did not
move upon their own initiative. For this reason, whatever
attitude the English, Dutch, and Swedish colonial govern-
ments assumed toward each other, it was the result of the
policy determined by their respective home governments.
It was the political, religious, and economic conditions of
aiiairs in Europe that determined their policies. The wars

of the Reformation being the all-absoihing * internationa]
events of the period, the paramount issue then was, of
course, Roman Catholic or Protestant supremacy.

The close association of £nghind and the Netherlands
began in Elizabeth's reign. The Emperor Charles V. had
abdicated and Philip 11. had succeeded him as King of Spain
in 1556. Philip began his persecution of the Netherlands
almost immediately, and later was morally supported in his
policy by his wife, Mary Tudor of England. In 1569,
during the reign of Elizabeth, England was engaged in a
quarrel with Alva as head of the Spanish government in
the Netherlands. It resulted in almost the destruction
of the Flemish trade. From 1572 to 1580, Elizabeth car-
ried on against Spain a piratical war under the leadership of
Drake. This was Jargcly in consequence of the nith1e&lt;;s war
waged against Protestantism in the Netherlands by Philip II.
Toward the close of the year 1575, envoys were sent to
Elizabeth to solicit her aid, and, under certain conditions,
to offer her the sovereignty of Holland and Zealand. She
was not ready to fight Spain openly, and could not be in-
duced to grant the Hollanders a loan. Ten years later the
same offer was made and again declined. This time, how-
ever, Elizabeth despatched troops to the Netherlands and
sent her tavontc, the* harl ot Leicester, to command. At
the same time, she played the Netherlands false by intriguing
with the Spaniards.

In 1596, the English and Dutch, under the command of
Lord Admiral Howard and the Earl of Essex, captured and
plundered Cadiz. The Spanish navy was crippled, the city
was destroyed, and millions in plunder were taken. The
most important alliance, however, occurred in 1625, during
the Thirty Years' War. The representatives of the princes
of the Empire induced three nations of the Reformed faith —
England, Holland, and Denmark — ^to ally themselves for
. the purpose of assisting their oppressed brethren. England
sent subsidies, Holland supplied troops, and the command
of the delivering army was confided to Christian IV., King



82 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



of Denmark. Three years later (1628), Gustavus Adolphus
first made his sensational entrance into the war in Grcr-

many; and in 1631 he was assisted by England with money
and with about six thousand English and Scotch volunteers.
We may say, then, that almost from the accession of Eliza-
beth, in 1558, down to the passage of the Navigation Acts,
in 1 65 1, under Cromwell, England and the Netherlands
had a friendly understanding. Seldom during that period
were the two nations at odds, and frequently were they
openly allied in defence of Protestantism. Sweden fought in
defence of the same principles that had actuated England and
Holland. The community of religious and political interests
among England, Holluad, and Sweden — but particularly
between England and Holland — was the main reason fur
the tolerant spirit of the colonial governments of the three
nations. At home, they were friends and even allies. They
were fighting a great war for religious and political liberty,
and they did not want to take steps with reference to each
other that mig^t be considered unfiiendly, let alone hostile.
A Cdse move in North America on the part of any one of
the colonial governments might have caused disastrous re-
sults in Europe. Politics were so nearly balanced there
that a hasty move on the part of any one of the Protestant
allies might have destroyed the equilibrium.

Stuyvesant's third plea for peace and unity between the
Dutch and English in America was their common dai^qrs
from their common enemies." At the time Stuyvesant
wrote there is no questioning the importance of the Euro-
pean danger. During this period and for more than half a
century prior to it, the common enemies of England and the
Netherlands were Spain and Austria. From 1560 to about
1660, there is scarcely a decade when England was not
hostile to Spain, either openly or covertly. During the greater
part of that century the same may be said of the Nether-
lands and Spain. The common enemy of England and
Holland at the time Stuyvesant wrote was Spain. Stuyve-
sant wrote this letter to Governor Winthrop, it will be

recalled, on May 24, 1648. The Peace of Westphalia was
not signed until the 24th of October, 1648. From 161 8,
when Ferdinand precipitated hostilities in Bohemia, until
the signature of the Peace in 1648, the Protestant and
Roman Catholic nations were engaged in a great struggle
for supremacy and, in some cases, even for existence. This
period of the Thirty Years' War includes the first part of
the period of the struggle tor the possession of the Hudson
and the Delaware valleys by the English, the Dutch, and
the Swedes settled in America. These three nations were,
at the same time, fighting in Europe in defence of religious
and political liberty. Their common danger was imperial
tyranny and their common enemy was Spain.

Stuyvesant's fourth reason for urging peace and union as
between the Dutch and En^sh colonies in America was
the ^ known malice of the barbarians" to both of those
nations. The danger from the Indians was particularly
great at that time. They continuously threatened the very
existence of the white settlements until the overthrow of
King Philip in 1676. The danger was indeed great, and
the white settlers could ill afford to waste their &lt;^treng^
in an intercolonial war. The Iroquois confederation was
always a source of great danger. Although they were at
that time on friendly terms with both the Dutch and the
English, yet no one could tell when their friendship might
turn into rnmity. Stuv^ csnnt himself had been accused
by the English of New Haven of attempting to raise the
Mohawks against the English. His indignant denial of
the accusation shows how sLriuasI; he regarded the danger
of an Indian uprising against the domination of the whites.
There is no doubt whatever of his entire innocence. He
was righteously indignant at the accusation and considered
it a vicious slander.

The Dutch on the Delaware, tn turn, made a like accu-
sation against the Swedes. Reference has already been
made to the quarrel between Huddf and Prints — ^Hudde
claimed that an abortive attack of the Indians upon the

Dutch WIS due to Printz's undurbdan tchemiiigi. The
aecuiations and counter accusations weie only £e begyi-
ning of many siinikr disputes among the English, the
Fiencb, and die Dutch colonial governments. Such accu-
sations characterized all intercolonial disputes down to the
end of the American Revolution. £ach nation accused
every other nation of starring up or attempting to stir up
the Indians against the other colonies. The indictment
WIS frequently not without foundation in fact. This was
particularly true in the great French-English duel for suprem-
acy in America that began with King William's War in
1690 and ended with the close of the French and Indian
War in 1763. We shall find that one of the main causes
of the hostilities between the Dutch of New Amsterdam and
the English of New England was the mutual recrimination
with respect to tampering with the Indians. Both claimed
that the I tlu [ ha l secretly induced the Indians to go upon
the warpath aiid had sold ihcm guns axid aiumuiULion for
that purpose.

Viewing the question in the light of subsequent develop-
ments, we are ahle to add to these four pleas made by Stuy-
vesant for peace and unity certain other important reasons
why " peace and unity*' were sustained. At least, why
they were sustained as between the Dutch and the Swedes
until 1655^ and as be tw ee n the Dutch and the English until
1664. The four pleas uiged by Stuyvesant explain satis-
factorily why hostilities between the three rivals did not orig^
nate with the home governments. As long as the latter were
at peace with one another, and particularly as long as they
were open allies in a common cause, their colonial policies
would be friendly; at kast, not ovotly hostile. But the
policy of the home country could not always control the acts
of the colony. There were very good reasons for this, and
among them might be mentioned: the great distance of the
colony from the home government; the great struggle of
the Thirty Ye.irs* War that covered the hrst half of the
period under discussion and demanded the whole attention

MAINTENANCE OF THE STATUS 85



of the nations engaged in itj and lastly, the necessity of
giving the colonial guvcriiment a considerable degree of lati-
tude in the numagement of its own affairs. There were
times wheii the coluiiists ejf all three nations had to act
and act promptly without instructions from their home
governments. There were times when the very existence
of the colony demanded such action, even when the action
threatened to lead to international complications.

From this it would seem that the colonial governments
of the three colonies might have heen led very easily into
a war with one another, despite the peace policy of the home
governments* The very reasonable defence could have been
made that the exigencies of the situation demanded prompt
action and that a delay for instructions from the home gov-
ernment might have proved disastrous. Several times the
colonial governments were upon the eve of taking just such
action, but were prevented from doing so by the satisfactoxy
solution of the problem at hand.

In addition, then, to Stuyvesant's fourth plea for peace
there were three important reasons why it was -sustained.
These three reasons, like his fourth plea, were local in
character. While the first three pleas of Stuyvewmt will
explain the policy of peace on the part of the home govern-
ments, it will take his fourth plea in conjunction with these
others to explain the policy of peace sustained by the colonial
govern meiits.

In the first place, the English, Dutch, and Swedish colo-
nists had some doubt themselves as to the validity of tlieir
individual claims to definite tracts of land in the disputed
territory. This was particularly true in the case of the
English colonists of New Haven and their claims to certain
lands in the Delaware \ . Their doubt as to the validity
of their own claims was nor, of course, adn^itted to the rival
nationalities. But we find several eonimunications with the
home government in which the request is made that an
opinion be given upon the validity of their claims. A typical
illustration to wluch reference has alrduly been made will



86



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



be fufficient for our purpose. We will recall that Stuyve-
tant impntoned the mettengen of the New Haven expe-
dition that stopped at New Amatefdam to pay him their
lespecti in 1651. The United Colonies of New England
mollified the people of New Haven by empty promiies and
wrote Stuyvesant a latber bombastic letter. In addition, a
letter was written to the agent of the United Colonies at
London, Mr. Edward Winslow, complaining of the con-
duct of the Dutch. After pointing out the destiabiliQr of
defending the English title to the Delawaie valley, the com-
missioners naively call attention to the veiy grave weakness
of that same tide. They were not quite sure that their
neglect to improve the lands in dispute had not invalidated
their title to them. To make this point ver}' clear, the
agent wns requested to feel the pulse of Parhament or of
the Council of State to discover how their cbims were
regarded; whether or not their failure to improve the lands
in dispute had invalidated their title to them under the old
patents. They wanted to know, likewise, whether any
later grants of the lands in qacsiiun had been made by Par-
liafnent; and if so, whether the rights of bona purchasers
under the old patents had bet n regarded.

When the contesting colonists were not by any means
sure of the validity of their titles to the lands in dispute,
they would have committed a grass error had they recklessly
begun hostilities. They could not have depended upon the
support of the home government in the event that their
titles to the land in dispute proved invalid. Not one of the
colonial governments had the courage bom of a conviction
that its title to the land in dispute was indispuuble. This
was particularly true in the case of the English and the
Swedes. We have already remarked that the title of Hol-
land in the Delaware valley was much clearer than those of
her two rivals.

In the second place, had the English title to the settle-
ments on the Delaware been entirely valid, the chances are
that the English colonies could not have united upon a

common plan of action. There was a most decided want of
community of interest between the New England colonies
and tlie Southern colonies. New England differed from Vir-
ginia and Maryland so essentially^religioiisly, politicalij,
and socially^ — that there was not the proper foundation at
that time for unity of action even against colonists of another
nation. Puritan New England had little in common with
Cavalier Virginia. It must be borne in mind that this clash
between the three nationalities in the three river valleys
approximately coincided with the great struggle in England
between Charles I. and Parliament, and later, after the exe-
cution of the king, between the Cavalier and the Puritan
interests. Charles I. became king in it)25 and was be-
headed in 1649. The Commonwealth lasted from 1649
to 1653, and the Protectorate tVom 1653 to the Restoration
in 1660. The clash between the English and the Dutch on
the Connecticut began in 1635 ; between the Dijtch and the
Swedes on the Delaware, in 1638; and between the Dutch,
the Swedes, and the English on the Delaware, in 164 1. New
Sweden was conquered bv the Dutch in 1655, and New
Netherland was conquered by the English in 1664. From
1635 to 1664, then, we may say that the rival nations con-
tested tor the possession of the three river valleys. Thus
we see that with the exception oi the last four or five
years of this period the issue between the Puritans and
the Cavaliers was very tightly drawn. Virginia was Cava-
lier. New England was Puritan. Their sympathies in the
neat English revolution were respectively Cavalier and
Puritan. They probably could not have united In a move-
ment to oust the Dutch and the Swedes liom the three
river valleys had they been left by the home government
to follow dieir own inclinations in the matter* As evidence
of this fact we have but to point to the failure of the vari-
ous schemes for a consolidation of the English colonies
in America before the great issue of the American Revo-
lution afforded the necessary foundation for united action,

Plan of Union at the Albany Conventbn in 1754; Brad-

failed to accomplish the end sought. Unification of the
English colonics in America was the object in view, hut
the mutual jealousies between colony and colony and the
miitiuLl distrust of the colonics and of the mother country
pt ( vented the successful cuitninauon of these various plans
tor unihcation.

In the third place, there were dissensions between the
four culuiHcs comprising the United Colonies of New Eng-
land. These colonies united were strong enough without
the help of the oihei colonies to wage a successful war
of conquest against the Dutch and the Swedes. The
New England Confederation was formed at Bostoii in
^Axf^ 1643, &lt;lclcgates from Plymouth, Massachusetts
Bay, ConiMcticut, and New Haven C&lt;4Qnies. From that
time until its practical dissolution in 1684, the records of
the United Colonies are full of evidences of the disagree*
ments, jealousies, and mutual recriminations of these four
Puritan colonies.

The facts that have heen thus brougjht forward In the
course of this discussion should go a long way toward
answering satisfactorily the questions asked at the begin*
ning of the chapter. Namely, why, prior to 1655, did not
the Dutch, the English, and the Swedes resort to open and
declared warfare in their triangular contest for the posses-
sion of the Delaware valley ? Why did not the Dutch of
New Netherland declare war upon the Swedes of New
Sweden and exterminate them? Why did not the Enelish
wage war against the Dutch? Why was each of the three
colonial tM)vcrnments so tolerant of the other two ? Answers
to these questions have been found in the seven reasons
just adduced, namely: first, their unity of faith; secondly,
the traditional political union of their respective home coun-
tries—especially as between the English and the Dutch;
thirdly, their common danger from their common enemies;

CHAPTER V



DVrCH CONGEST Of NEW SIFSDEN, 1647-1655

When Peter Stuyvesant aMumed control of the govern-
ment of New Netherland on the iith of May, 1647,
ereryone felt instinctively that a man of character had suc-
ceedied the worthless Kieft^ by whom New Netherland had
been brought to the verge of nun. A fourth part of the
dty of New Amsterdam, it is said, consisted of grog shops
and houses where nothing could be got but tobacco and
beer. Needless to say, drunkenness and broils were of
common occurrence. Reliction and education were neg-
lected. A church begun 111 1642 was unfinished — the
director-gciuml appropriating to his own use the fines and
fork- It u res set aside for its completion. No attempt was
niLLtic to Christianize the savao-c. Harvard College was
founded in 1 636, but by 164O not even a ( iminon primary
school had been established in New Netherland. The
funds that had been collected for a schoolhouse in New
Amsterdam had been misappropriated. Agriculture was
neglected. Scarcely hfty houweries " existed outside of
Long Island. In 1643, poiujl.ition of New Netherland
numbcrL'J three tliuusand, while in 1646 it had dwindled to
about one thousand. The whole province could not fur-
nish more than three hundred men capable of bearing arms.
The Indians had lost one thousand six hundred of their
people in the war of 1641 and were in a dangerous mood.
The government was disorganized and the people were dis-
contented. Smuggling had almost ruined legitimate trade

and had cut off the usual source of government revenue.

The patroons and the Company were at odds over con-
flicting claims of jurisdiction. The very existence of New
Netherland was threatened by the rival fjiglish colonies.

It must be admitted, however, in extenuation of K left's
policy, that he had a most difficult task in the administra- ;
tion of the government of his province. He was far distant j
from the source of his military supplies, and had but a hand- |
ful of soldiers crowded in a dilapidated fort with which to j
bastaia his power and to repel attacks. The population !
wrts small, "turbulent and unreliable." The province was ^
suirounded by sav .il:('s ever on the alert for "rapine and :
murder," and u thicatcned by the English in New Eng-
land and by the Swedes on the Delaware. The States

General had all it could do to maintain its independence, \
while the Company regarded the province moely as a
source of eommeiaal gain« The former could not spate
the time to supervise the affiurs of the colony and the latter
merely exploited it, giving in return very little support.
With dissensions widbin, with attacks from without, and
with an absence of hearty support from the governing
powers, Kieft's task was indeed not an easy one. Yet,
there is little doubt but that not a few of his difficulties
were caused by his want of tact, by his imprudence, by
his rashness, and by bis arbitmiy actbns. It may be said
truthfully that many of his embarrassments here cited were
largely of his own creation : it was more the man than his
environment. He brought the colony to its lowest ebb.
We shall see what changes were brought about under his
successor.

Such was the condition of affairs when Fctcr Stuyvesant,
the last Director-general of New Netherland, assumed con-
trol of the government. For several years prior to his
coming he had been in the Company's service as director of
its colony at Cura^oa. There he had distinguishc d himself
by his energy and braver)'. He had lost a Ic^ in an attack
on the Portuguese settlement at St. Martin's, and it was un

his return to Europe for surgical aid that he was pboed in
charge of New Netherland while still retaining his former
commission. His very first speech, as weU as his whole
personal bearing, was indicative of what manner of man he
was* shall govern you as a father his children, for the
advantage of the chartered West India Company, and these
btirjrhers, and this land/* said he, in summing up his view
of the situation and his relation to it. It is said that he put
on airs and strutted about, like a peacock, with great state
and pomp. Some of the representative citizens on going to
welcome him were left to wait for several hours bareheaded,
while he "as if he were the Czar of Muscovy remained
covered." The transmission of the government from Kieft
to himself was made as spectacular as possible. Tile wiiuie
community was called to witness the ceremony.

Stuyvesant was bom about 1602, land was the son of a
deigyman, the Rev. Balthazar Stuy vesant. He had a college
education and considered himself well versed in Latin. Upon
leaving college, he entered the army. He married Judith
Bayard, the granddaug^iter of a French Protestant clergyman.
This clergyman was Nicholas Bayard, who, after the Mas-
sacre of St. Bartholomew's, in, 1572, escaped to the Nether-
lands. As to Peter Stuyvesant's personality, we have an
admirable description by the veracious Diedrich Knickei^
bocker : ^^A valiant, weather-beaten, mettlesome, obstinate,
leathern-sided, lion-hearted, generous-spirited old governor."
His manner was most autocratic and his speech was very
abrupt — often offensively so. He was diligent m furthering
.the interests of his superiors; and when he had decided as
to what those interests were, he was verv prompt in action.
He was not the one to brook opposition, aiid his arbitrary
conduct again precipitated the old struggle between the set-
tlers and the director-general.

His lirst act was to organize his council, and almost his
second act was to begin issuing proclamations. This he did
with quite as mudi zeal as Kieft had shown. Sabbath break-
ing, brawling, and drunkenness were forbidden. Liquors

could not be sold, except to travellers, before two o'clock
on Sundays, when there was no preaching, otherwise not
before four o*cIock, and after nine o'clock in the evening.
The selling of liquor to savages was forbidden at all times.
The most stringent regulations against smuggling were pro-
claimed, and a new excise duty on wines and liquors was
levied. The people protested without avail against these
exactions. It was *'like the crowning of Rehoboam," they
said; "if their yoke was heavy under Kieft, it was still
heavier under Stuyvesant." These regulations and rnnny
others of a petty character gave rise subsequently to a power-
ful opposition to his administration. The excuse for such
exactions might have been the emptiness of the provincial
treasury ; but no excuse was offered. The finances of the
colony were in a very disorganized condition. The war
had ruined the farmers and they were consequently unable
to stand taxation. To supplement the resources of the
treasur\ , the Company's vachts (.V./ and Love were de-
spatched Oil a cruise. As Holland was at war with Spain, it
was hoped some of the enemy's richly laden galleons might
be captured.

There seemed to be a most manifest unwillingness on
the part of the people to furnish the funds necessary for the
carrying out of some of the most pressing of Stuyvesant's
instructions. The fort needed repairs, and the Indians had
not been ^ven the presents promised them at the close of
the war. The director-general was helpless, being with-
out money or goods. In the midst of .his difficulties, he
called his Council together and told it the exact condi-
tion of ailairs. He was advised very tactfully that the only
way to get the funds needed was to yield to the popular
demand for representation. The people could then express
their wishes and make known their wants; otherwise, they
were not willing to be taxed without their consent. In
accordance with the advice of the Council, an election was
held in September, 1647, at which the people of Manhattan,
Breukelen, Amersfoort, and Favonia chose eighteen of their

" most notable, reasonable, honest, and respectable " citizens.
Of these, according to the custom of Holland, the director
and his Coitncii were to select nine men "as good and faith-
ful interlocutors and trustct-s of the commonalty." When
invited to do so, they were permitted to "advise and assist"
in promoting the general \\ el fare of the province.

The charter of concessions was dated September 25,
1647. 0*Callaghan says of it, "meagre though it was in
privileges and concessions, it deserves notice as marking the
glimmering of popular freedom at this remote day." Of
die Nine Men, three were selected firom among the mer-
chants, three from the citizens* and three from &amp;t farmers.
Prior to the Indian war, the privily had been granted the
citizens of electing a Board, first of twelve and later of
eig^t men. We will recall the fiict that under Kieft the
former was extinguished as soon as it demanded an exten-
sion of political power; whilst the latter was completely
ignored by the director-general in all important matters
of State. The Nine Men, however, were given a little
more authority. They were to be consulted on all matters
of importance. They were given limited judidaiy powers
— sitting in council in rotation to judge civil cases. Those
who cnntemncd their decision or appealed from it were fined.

Stuy\ esaiit carefully hedc^ed these mcnjxre pri'^ i lenses. The
director-general could attend the meetings in person and act
as president or could appoint one of his Council to act in
his stead. Only in the first election was the selection to be
made by the voters. Later, the Nine Men were to numinate
their successors. In each year, six of the nine were to
retire, but were eligible for reelection. This provision is
found in Section IV of the charter. Annually, in December,
six were to leave their seats, and from the most notable
citizens twelve were to be nominated, who, *^with the Nine
assembled, shall be communicated to lis, without Our being
nqmred to call in futun the wboli cmnunalty ttgetber** Out
of the twelve the director and Council were to select six.
The Nine Men thus formed a self-perpetuating body.

Stityvcnnt so oonttnicted the charter that thejr mig^ fill
more and more under his influence. In this, however, he
was not altogether successful. The Nine contrived to act
more or less independently, and represented as best they
could the interests of the people. These were but the
beginnings of constitutional government, yet the advance
over the administration of Kieft was very marked* It is
significant that this representation was a clear concession in
return for taxation.

This popular body being organized, Stuyvesant lost no
time in calling their special attention to the sad condition
of the fort, to the want of a suitable church edifice, to the
disgraceful state of public education in New Amsterdam,
and to the mean appearance of the city itself. Most of the
houses in New Amstcidam were built of wood aiui thatched
with straw. Many of the chimneys were of wood. This
sutement was communicated to the Nine Men in writing,
Stuyvesant being confined to bis room by an attack of
influenza, which was epidemic in New Netherland at that
time. Most of the propositions made by the director-general
were approved and a tax was voted. The Nine refused,
however, to provide means for repairing the fort, holding
very justly that the Company had agreed by the charter of
X629 to maintain the defences. This, they held, was no
more than right, inasmuch as the people were required to pay
customs, duties, excises, and tolls at the Company's mill.

Stuyvesant's relations with the Nine Men were very
soon complicated by the larger issues that characterized
his administration. He was shrewd, intcljic^cnt, sound in
mind and judgment, but his abrupt, nutocratic, imperious
manner led him into many difficulties. This manner was
due to some extent to his military training, but for the most
part it was bom in him. He could no more rid himself of
it than he could replace his wooden leg with a sound one
of flesh, biooti, aiici bone. From the beginning ot his ad-
ministration—or reigrty for that word more nearly character-
izes his attitude toward the people — in 1647 to its overthrow

by the English in 1664 he was in the midst of a continuous
round of disputes. This period of New Necheriand hia-
toiy might be treated very aptly under the headings of his
diffieient quarrels. First, he quarrelled with the colonial
patroons; then, with the English in New England; then,
with the Swedes on South River; and finally^ with his
own people of New Netherland. However, he was not
able' to isolate these disputes in such a manner that he
might have hut one on his hands at a time. He was either
not adroit enough to do this, or uncontrollable circumstances
made it impossible. Probably it was due to both these
circumstances tiiat he frequently had two or three quarrels
on his hands at one time. With his people he quarrelled
almost incessantly. The insatiably laiW-hungry Yankees
continuously pressed over the territorial boundaries of New
Netherland. The Swedes loudly proclaimed their rights
to lands on Soudi River in exact proportion to the lack of
validity of tfaeur titles. The colonial patroons continued as
of yore to infringe upon the privileges of the Company in
every way that Dutch ingenuity asnsted by distance from
the governmental centre could suggest. Frequently, then,
at the same time Stuyvesant would be engaged in disputes
with the £nglish and the Swedes about tenr^tori^d chums ; with
the colonial patroons in regard to the respective merits of
Company and patroonship privily; ;md with his own
people as to what were the prerogatives of the director and
the privileges of the people. When it was not all these
disputes together, it was a combination of some two or three
of them. Attacked on South River by the Swedes; the
object of anathemas hurled at him from New England;
hectored by the silent schemings for aggrandizement on the
part of the Colonial patroons; and execrated by a large part
of the commonalty — it is no wonder that the governor
frequently lost his temper, which was none too amiable at
the best. The wonder is that he succeeded in keeping
his head above the waters of the deluge that continually
threatened to engulf him. A less valorous man would

have succumbed long before tbe English tidal wave finally
swamped him in 1664.

An account of Stuyvesant's quarrels, then, is a history
of his administration. His dispute with New England and
his more important troubles with his own people we shall
consider in die next chapter. After a brief statement of his
attempts at preserving the privileges of the Company against
the unwarranted encroachment of the colonial patroons, we
shall consider at some length the immediate difficulties that
led to the final overthrow of the Swedish power on South
River. The quarrel between the Dutch and the Swedes on
South River has been brought up to the year 1647, when
the assumption of power by Stuyvesant introduced a most
vigorous policy in the maintenance of Dutch rights to the
territory on that river. Before continuing this subject,
however, let us turn tor a moment's notice to the dispute
between ^nn vesnfit and the colonial patroons. The scene
of the narrauve iics for the most part in the north of New
Nctherland.

By the terms of Stuvvesant's commission, which the
States General issued to him on July 28, 1646, he was
required to promote the affairs of and to maintain in eood
order " everything for the ^.ervice of the United Nethcrlaiid
and the General West India Company." Most of Stuyve-
sant's troubles with the patroons and with the commonalty
may be traced to his honest determination to carry out these
instructions of his commission. He was determined to
maintain the prerogative of the West India Company at
all hazards, whether against the people of the province, the
lordly patroons, the Swedes, or the English. For the most
part, he was impersonal in his enforcement of these pre-
rogatives. Even his imperious bearing and his lordly self-
esteem might be credited in part to his realization of the
fact that he represented the privileges of the West India
Company on the one hand and the sovereignty of the States
General on the other. Occupying somewhat the position
of a feudal lord, he had to pay some heed to the rather

DUTCH CONi^ESr Of NEiV SiVEDEN



99



shadowy power of the States Geneial and much more heed to
the very material power of the West India Company. The
patroons were of the character of feudal chiefs, over whom
the director-general was required to assert ^an authority
which they refused to acknowledge." The interests of the
Company were Stuyvesant's first concern, and whoever or
whatever opposed these interests he attacked most uncom-
promisingly. In this he was no respecter of persons, as is
evidenced hy his frequent clashes with those hig|i in offi-
cial power. This is very aptly illustrated in an incident
that occurred on his voyage to New Netherland to assume
the directorship. His little fleet had captured a Spanish ship
and he invited Van Dincklagen, his vice-director, to consult
with him as to the best disposal of the prize. Van Dyck,
the treasurer, very naturally supposing his attendance was
expected, entered the cabin. But no sooner had he put his
foot inside than Stuyvesant gave him a push none too gentle,
at the same time exclaiming; "Get out of here! when I
want you I'll call for you!"

From the moment when the patroons first phiiued colo-
nies m New Netherland, jealousies arose between them and
the directors of the West India Company. The continuance
of the patroon colonies was opposed. They wxTe consid-
ered injurious to the country. For this reason, Pa\ onia and
Zvvaanendal were repurchased in 1634 and the patroon of
Rensselaerwyck was requested to cede to the Company his
privileges and possessions. Failing to secure Rensselaer-
wyck, the ducctors next attempted to circumscribe the
jurisdictions and to weaken the power of the patroons.



The two representatives of these conflicting interests of the
Company and the patroon were respectively Stuyvesant and
Brant van Slechtenhorst. To the latter was intrusted the
immediate management of Rensselaerwyck, with the official
titles of Director of the Colony, President of the Court of
Justice, and ^Superintendent of all the bouweries, farms,
mills and other property belonging to the patroon." He
knew full well the chartered prerogatives of his patroon.

and was determined to brook nn interfrrrncc with the in
from any outside authority. T he director-general might
issue as many proclamations as he saw fit, but he would
not recognize them unices they wexe endorsed by his own
superior, the patroon.

It was perfectly evident that where two such nun as
Van Slechtenhorst and htuyvesaiu came tugetiier with two
such conflicting claims to authority there was bound to be an
explosion. It came almost within a month of the former's
assumption of the superintendency of Rentfekerwyck. Stuy-
vetant procktmed the fint Wednesday in May, 1648, at a
day for ftsting and for public worship in the churches of
New Ketherland. A copy of the proclamation was for-
warded to Rensaeherwyck and arrived April 26th. It was
not received in &lt;*thac spirit of submissive obedience which
the Director Genend demanded for all of bis orders." It
was considered an invasion of the pierogarive of the patroon^
and Van Slechtenhorst protested ag^sc it. Scuyvesanc
considered this act as dangerously approaching treason, and
the thought with him was coincident with action. He
gathered up a military escort and proceeded to Fort Orange.
Upon his arrival and departure he was honored by several
salutes from the patroon's three pieces of cannon. So say
the records, at least, and in addition we are informed that
Van Slechtenhorst purch:rsrd twenty pounds of powder,
spent twenty guilders for beer and victuals, and provi ii d
the " Heer General" upon his departure with divers young
fowls and [n u

Van ^icL lUciiliorst was summoned before the director-
general and charged with infringing; the Company's sover-
eignty. 1 he former was a foe man worthy of the old
general's steel. He replied: "Your complaints arc unjust;
I have more reason to complain, on behalf of my patroons,
againtt you." In answer to this, Stuyvesant di«w up a
long list of protests and ordered Van Slechtenhorst to cor-
rect all the abuses mentioned. The latter denied iir ttu
the director-general's right to interfere in the affiurs of the

patroonship and refused point-blank to be governed by his
proclamations. Retort followed retort until the departure
of Stuyvesant. No sooner had that depanure be en made
than Van Slechtenhorst continued to conduct atiairs in direct
opposition to tlu' commands of Stuyvesant, This exasper-
ated the director-general hcyand measure. A squad of
soldiers was sent to Fort Orange with orders to arrest
Van Slechtt nhorst if necessary, in the most civil manner
possible, and serve upon hiin a summons to appear at: }-"ort
Amsterdam to answer for his conduct. These soldiers were
not very well qualified to carry out instructions demanding
tuch tact. They destroyed the patroon's timber and killed
liit deer, and th^ wm imdent to the commander. This
nide conduct, together with their instructions to pull down
lioiises within close proximity to the fort, aroused the ire of
even the Indians. They demanded if Wooden Leg, in
whom they had confided as their protector, intended to tear
down the houses which were to shelter them in stormy and
wintiy weather?" If land were all he wanted, his soldiers
could accompany them home, and they would he given
plenty of land in the Minqua country.

Van Slechtenhorst was ordered peremptotily to appear at
a coutt to he held in April at New Amsterdam. He refused
to obey the commands of the director-general and made a
long and angry protest. The dispute continued with vary-
ing degrees of intensity until 1651, when it agun reached
a climax. A call for a subsidy brougfit a protest from
Rensselaerwyck, and Van Slechtenhorst was sent to New
Amsterdam to remonstrate with the director and Council
against it. Shortly after his arrival he was arrested and
detained four months before he made his escape. The
trouble grew more serious, until the following year, 1652,
witnessed the close of what 0*Callaghan calls " Van Slecht-
enhorst's reign." On April 18th, nine armed soldiers burst
into his house nnd, without any preliminaries, dragged him
I to Fort Orange a prisoner, "against all his protest*;, where

to speak to bim," whilst ^ his furs, bis clothes, and his meat
were left hanging on the door-posts, and his house and papeis
were abandoned to the merqr of his enemies," He was
then carried to New Amsterdam, **to be tormented, in his
sickness and old age, with unheard-of and insuficiable perse&gt;
Gutions, by those serving a Christian government, professing
the same religion, and living under the same authority."
The patroon and co-directors of Rcnsselaerwyck sent on
December 1 6, 1 65 2, a vigorous protest to the Amsterdam
Chamber, complaining of what they termed Stuyvesant's
high-handed measures. The directors replied in vague
tenns, and the patroon immediately addressed a memorial
to the States General, demanding justice and redress. The
Amsterdam Chamber, after considerable delay, replied to
some of the charges brought against Stuyvesant, their
agent in New Netherland. The directors then taking
the offensive made counter charges against the agents
of the patroon. In the end, the dispute was settled entirely
to the satisfaction of ihe director-generaL He was sustained
at even' point.

While these events were occurring on North Ri\ cr, Dutch
interests on South River were not altogether neglected hy
the authorities at New Amsterdam. The Dutch settlements
on South River, however, might have fallen into a state of
utter decay had it not been for the loyal efforts of one man,
Commissan' Hudde. He, as we have seen, infused great
acti\ ity into affairs in that quarter and appears to have made
fvcrv endeavor to extend Dutch influence and dominion.
He found it bv no means an easv task, however, for in that
vicinity the Swedish Company was more powerful than the
Dutch Companv. '1 he Suedes were extremely arrogant
and evidently desired to pick a quarrel, with the end in \ iew
of driving the Dutch from the river. Printz, the Governor
of New Sweden, was as zealous in the interests of the
Swedes as was Hudde in the interests of the Dutch. He
had been tampering with the Minquas and had endeavored
to obtain their consent to the erection of a fort in their

country, by means of which he expected to tecure from
thirty to forty thousand beavers annually.

With this end in view he had fortified the mouth of the
Schuyikil] — the highway to the Minquas* territory. On
hearing this, the Indians of Passavunk invited the Dutch to
build j. tradins: post at that [&gt; 1' urtlicrniore, to show

their sincerity, ihcy had warned the Swedes away and had
planted on the ground, with their own hands, the standard
of the FHnce of Orange. Hudde proceeded without delay
to put the project into execution. No sooner had Fort
Bevertieede heen completed, April 27, 1648, than Hen-
drick Huyghens, the Swiedish commimry, arrived with seven
or eight men, and demanded hy what authority Hudde had
erected that building? ^By order of my masters and the
previous consent of the savages," was' the reply. Moens
Kling, the commander of the Swedish foit in the vicinity,
arrived later with twenty-four armed men. They were
ordered to lay down their musitets and take up their axes,
whereupon they cut down ever)' tree near the place — even
the fruit trees which Hudde had lately planted.

Intelligence of this violence soon reached New Amster-
dam, and Vice-director Van Dincklagen and Jean de la
Montagne were commissioned by the Council to investigate
the affair. They arrived on the "th of June, 1648, and
several days later, in the presence of Printz, made a protest
agairist his illegal occupation of the Schuylkill. The com-
missioners did little else than meet the Indians and have
them confirm past and present purchases of land. Far from
exerting a restraining inr. umce upon Printz, the visit seemed
to exasperate iuin lo turtlicr deeds of violence. U is not
necessary to mention in detail the numerous disputes that
took place between the Dutch and the Swedes in the neigh-
boihood of the Schuylkill. They were nearly all of minor
importance, hut at the same time they were exceedingly
irritating to Dutch pride.

Many of these petty incidents were recited to Stuyve-
tant hy Hudde when the latter, in response to a summons.

visited Manhattan in September of 1648. He returned in
October and continued to issue protests against the encroach-
ments of the Swedes ; for the desire for peace on the part
of his superiors seems to have limited him to paper warfare.
The manner of addressing Printz in these protests not in-
accurately gives us an idea of the tone of their contents.
Now the protest would begin : " To the noble governor,
De Heer J&lt;ihn Printz — Sir Governor ; " then it would read:
"Noble and valiani: John Pnnr/ while later it would run:
" Honorable and obliging good fi icnd — accept my coidial
salutation or: "Noble honorable lord, John Printz.**
Hudde could do little else than to hurl protests at Printz.
To vindicate Dutch honor and to maintain Dutch rights,
to defend Forts Nassau and Beversreede, such weapons of
warfare were rather ineffSsctual* Hudde had but six able-
bodied men at this time on the river. The Swedes had it
all much their own way.

On November 9, 1648^ Secretaiy Van Tienhoven ad-
dressed a letter to Stuyvesant from Fort Beversreede sug-
gesting that it would be advisable for the latter to make a
trip to South River and look into the situation for himself.
Stuyvesant did not hnd the opportunity to make the trip
until July, 165 1. The Dutch West India Company had
finally come to a realization of the necessity of settling the
differences respecting the jurisdiction on South River with
Christina, Queen of Sweden. In a letter of instructions to
Stuyvesant, dated March 21, 165 1, the directors of the Com-
pany had already informed him of their intention to arrange
matters with the Swedes. In the mean time," the instruc-
tions read, "your honor will endeavor to maintain the rights
of the company, in all justice and equity, while we again
recommend that your honor will conduct himself with that
discretion and circumspection by which all complaints, dis-
putes, and coolness between friends and allies may be
avoided." This letter explains satisfactorily the spirit of
compromise with which Stuyvesant began and carried out his
visit to South River. It is also another incident in addition

to those already cited in a preceding chapter explanatory of .
the maintenance of the status quo.

Stuyvcsant arrived at Fort Nassau on South River, accom-
panied by Dominie Grasmcer and a large suite of officers.
He p^rasped fully the wisdom of terminating the feuds be-
tween the Dutch and Swedes and arriving at an under-
Standing with Pi iiuz. In this way their mutual enemy, the
English, might be kept out of that territory. With this
object in view, he communicated with Printz immediately
upon his airival. He explained tbe Dutch title to the huids
in dispute, and demanded an exhibition of the Swedish
title* The Dutch title was stated to rest on right of first
European discoveiy and occupation and upon actual pur-
chase from the Indians many years before the airival of the
Swedes. Prints merely replied that the Swedish limits were
^wide and broad enoug;h*" He was not able to show his
titles. He claimed that they were at Stockholm. One
of the chief sachems, Wappan-zewan, afterward informed
Stuyvesant^ however, that Printz was endeavoring at that .
very time to purchase from him the lands upon which the
Swedes were settled. Printz had maintained that he had
already purchased these lands. The Indians thereupon con-
veyed to Stuyvcsant, whom they cnllf-d "the (jrand Sachem
of the Manhattans," the title to the lands in dispute.

Stuvvesant succeeded in doing little toward carryiiiL: out
his mission except calling a council of Indian chiefs to meet
at Fort Nassau. After a solemn conference, the chiefs
pr&lt;;sentcd to the Dutch "as a free gift " large tracts of land.
The only conditions made were by Chief Pcmenatta, who
insisted that the Dutch should repair his gun when out of
order and give the Indians a little maize when they rt4uired
it. Fort Nassau, situated on the Jersey shore, being incon-
veniently far up the river, was demolished and a new fort
called Casimir was erected on the opposite bank of the
river, about four miles from Fort Christina. Printz pro-
tested most vigorously against the erection of the new
fort, but was nevertheless willing to arrive at some friendly

106 MIDDLE STJTSS AND MARYUND



understanding with Stuyvcsant before the !atter*s departure.
Both men mutuallv promised to cause no difficulties or hos-
tilities to each other, but to keep neighborly friendship and
correspondence together and act as friends and allies."
Having accomplivlu d ver\' little toward the amicable settle-
ment of affairs on ^outh River, Stuyvesant and his suite
returned to New Amsterdam.

1'hc linanccs of the Company at New Amsterdam were
veiy much disorganized by reason of this expedition. The
absolute necessities of the government could not be met
for the winter and this new debt paid at the same time.
The ancient expedient of paying off debts at fifty per cent
was resorted to. A certificate was given for the other half,
to be paid In goods the following year* The expedition
did not meet with the unqualified approval of the directors
of the West India Company. In a letter addressed to
Stuyvesant and dated April 4, 1652, they expressed their
surprise at the trip being made at all. They were not quite
sure that the demolition of Fort Nassau was an act of pru-
dence. They were at a loss to know for what reason the
new fort had been named Cnsimir — it being more nearly
a Srvfdish name than a Dutch name. The project of build-
ing another fort on the east bank of South River was left
to his discretion. He was warned to be on his guard lest
the new fort be surprised and captured by the Swedes.

Temporarily', at least, a better state of feeling seemed to
exist between the Dutch and ihc Swedes on South River.
For some time prior to the building of Fort Casimir, the
Swedes had received no help from the mother country.
Printz, apprchennve of danger from the near vicinity of
the Dutch, or having become discouraged by the neglect
of the home authorities, or by reason of his unpopularity,
petitioned his government for permission to return home.
Without waiting for this permission, which arrived De-
cember 12, 1653, returned to Sweden, having left his
son-in-law, John Pappegoya, in temporary charge of afiktrs.
The people of New Sweden then petitioned Stuyvesant

DUTCH CONGEST OF NEW SWEDEN 107

to take them under his protection. Stuyvesant dedined,
however, to accede to their request until he could learn
the views of the Amsterdam Chamber. His superiors ad-
dressed a communication to him on November 4, 1653,
urging him to conduct himself with all possible prudence
toward the Swedes . . . carefully avoiding everything
which might give them offence, as it would be highly im-
proper to increase, at this critical period, the number of our
enemies." With regard to the petition of the Swedes to
be taken under the Dutch sovereignty, they rather encour-
aged the project, at the same time stating their willingness
to protect all who would be obedient to the Dutch laws.
Nevertheless, lIicv kli lurther action in the matter to the
director-general's discretion. Stuyvesant, how'cvei, did not
encoura«^c the colonists to change their allegiance. This
was the last opportunity of peaceably acquiring New Sweden,
for in the fall of 1654 the Swedish Company made a new
effort to improve the condition of its colony. It was time
something was done, for the colony had dwindled to sixteen
persons.

AHairs on South River, however, reached a crisis when
John Rysingh, formerly secretary of the College of C6m*
merce in Sweden, arrived. May 31, 1654, as a deputy gov-
ernor. He was accompanied by about three hundred persons
and was to succeed Printz as governor upon the latter's
departure from New Sweden. He received his appointment
from the General College of Commerce, to which the
government of Sweden had given the management of its
affairs on South River. He was in5?tructed to avoid a con-
flict with Stuyvesant and was particularly warned against
making any hostile demonstration against Fort Casimir.
But no sooner had he appeared before the fort than, in
violation of his instructions, he demaiuicd its surrender and,
in fact, the surrender of the whole river. Van Tienhoven
called upon the commander, Gerrit Bikker, to defend the
fort« «*What can I do?" the latter replied, in despair;
there is no powder." Shortly after, two guns loaded with



bigitized by Google



I08 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAHD



shot were fired over the fort as a signal, and almost at the
same time Swen Schttte rushed into the fort at the head of
twenty or thirty men and took possession of it. Bikker
offered no resistance whatever, but instead welcomed them
as friends and struck his flag. The Dutch soldiers were
then driven from the fort, and their goods, together with
those of Bikker, were confiscated. Practically eveiything in
the fort was taken. Bikker, in a letter to Stujrvesant, said :
^^I could hardly, by entreaties, bring it so far as to bear
that I with my wife and children were not likewise shut
out almost naked." Van Tienhoven and another com-
missioner were permitted to go to Rysingh to demand an
explanation of his conduct. Rysingh replied most curtly
that he had acted in pursuance of orders from the cn&gt;\vn
of Sweden; that the Swedish ambassadors at The Hague
had been assured by the States General and the West India
Company that the erection of the Dutch fort on Swedish
soii had not been authorized; and that if the Dutch were in
the way of the Swedes, then he was to "drive them oiF.'*
After vouchsafing this explanation, Rysingh gave Van Tien-
hoven a resounding slap on the breast, saying at the same
time: "Go! tell vour Governor that!"

Of the Lcn or twelve Dutch soldiers in the furt, si'\ t n or
eight, with Van 1'icnhoven, were sent to Manhatian. The
others, with Bikker and most of the colonists, after taking
an oath of allegiance to Sweden, were permitted to remain.
The name of the fort was changed to Fort T^rinity, be-
cause, according to Swedish accounts, it was captuicd on
Trinity Sunday. Bikker tent Stuyvesant an account of
the capture of the fort, as did also Rysingh in a letter dated
May 27, 1654. It was soon rebuilt under the superintend-
ence of Peter Lindstrom, the Swedish engineer. Lindstrom
also prepared a laig^ map for the Swedish government,
embracing both sides of Delaware River as far as Trenton.

The news of this piece of treachery, committed as it
was in time of peace and in direct opposition to special in-
structions, aroused the indignation of the Dutch at New

Amsterdam. Stu^veMnt was in the midst of his prep8i»-
tions for the defence of New Netherknd ag^st an ex-^
pected attaclL by the English. Consequently, he was not
able to retaliate immediately. This bit of Swedish folly
had, however, as a sequel the overthrow of New Sweden
and the appropriation of the territory by the Dutch. Stuy-
vesant did retaliate shortly by capturing a Swedish ship, the
Golden Shark^ in charge of Hendrick van Elsvvycic, and
bound for South River. The ship had entered the harbor
of Manhattan by mistake, and the captain had sent a boat
to Manhattan to secure a pilot to take him to South River.
Van Klswyck was sent to South River to invite Rysingh to
visit New Amsterdani to corUlr with Stuyvcsant for the
settlement of " unexpccLcd ditkrc iic( s," He was promised
a cordial reception, comfortable lodging, and touiteous
treatment. He declined the invitation and failed to send a
representative, although especially requested to do so. Stuy-
vesant then ccmfiscated the vessel and caigo, notwithstanding
a formal protest from Van Elswyck.

The news of the treacherous capture of Fort Casimir
soon reached HoUand. On November i6, 1654, the Am-
sterdam directors ordered Stuyvesant to *^ exert eveiy nerve
to revenge that injury, not only by restoring afiairs to their
former situation, but by driving the Swedes from every side
of the river, as they did with us.'' Two armed ships, the
King Sfkmm and the Great Christopher^ were fitted out, and
the drum was beaten daily in the streets of Amsterdam to
invite volunteers to embark in them on the proposed expe-
dition for the conquest of New Sweden, Stuyvesant was
likewise civen permission to press into service a sufficient
nam her of ships to complete the expedition. He was in-
structed to leave nothing untried to apprehend Bikker, for it
was difficult to say which was the more contemptible — the
capture of the fort by the Swedes, or its cowardly surrender
by the Dutch commander.

Stuyvesant now had a free hand to act, and it was neces-
sary to do so at once before reinforcements could reach the

Swedes. The unfortuiuLte war between the Dutch Re-
public and the English Commonwealth, which began July 8«
1652, ended in 1654. The day the news of peace reached
Manhattan (July i6th), was set apart as a thy of general
thanksgiving. Little dang^ was now apprehended in the
direction of New Eng^d. Furthermore, affiurs were in a
lather unsettled condition in Sweden. Axel Oxenstiem, the
faithful chancellor of Gustavus Adolphus and his daughter.
Queen Christina, who had done so much for the settle-
ment of South River, died in August, 1654. In the same
year Christina abdicated the throne of Sweden in hvor of
her cousin, Karl X. Gustaf — better known as Charles X.
After the Peace of Munster, Holland had no longer any
particular reason for avoiding interference with Sweden.

The winter of 1654 passed, however, without anything
overt being done. Protests and counter protests passed
between the Swedes and the Dutch relati\ e to the capture
and confiscation of the ship GoUin Shark and its cargo. In
(he spring of 1655, the directors engaged itom the Burgo-
masters of Amsterdam one of their "largest and best
vessels," tlie I tgilance^ of thirty-six guns. In this they sent
out ah additional force of two hundred men. Upon the
arrival of the Ft^ilaucc- at New Amsterdam, the expedition
was commandtd to start with all "possible despatch and
prudence," even though Stuvvesant had not vet returned
from a voyage he had undertaken to the West Iiwi: ■^.
Secrecy was enjoined, inasmuch as the directors had leariied
that itiimense preparations were being made m ^^weden to
reinforce the colony on S(juth River. Upon the river itself,
however, the Swedes were under slight apprehension as to
their security and did not learn of the military preparations
of their enemy until the punitive expedition was ahout to
start.

Stuyvesant, having returned from Barbadoes on August
1 6th, proclaimed the 25th of the same month as a general
&amp;st, thanks, and prayer day " for the success of the expedi-
tion. A call for volunteers was made and a pension promised

everyone who should he wounded in the service. Pilots
were engaged and all longshoremen were impressed into the
service* £ach merchantman was ordered to furnish two of
its crew and a proportionate share of provisions and ammu-
nition. Three river yachts were chartered, and a French
privateer, UEsperance^ just arrived at New Amsterdam, was
likewise engaged. In the midst of the preparations, a ques-
tion of some importance arose: Should the Jews be en-
listed ? " Stuyvesant was not long in settling the question*
" In the celebrated emporium of New Amsterdam,*' he de-
cided, Jews are not called to take part in such duties."
They were declared exempt, though they were perfectly
willing to serve. In lieu of service, a tax of sixty-five
stuivers a month was levied upon every Jew between the
ages of sixteen and sixtv.

On the 5th of September, Sunday, after the usual morn-
ing: service, every possible preparation having been made,
the little fleet set sail. It consisted of seven vessels, with a
force on board of from six to seven hundred men. Stuy-
vesant himself was in command and was accompanied by
Vice-&lt;liicctor De Sille and Dominie Megapolensis as chap-
lain. The next afternoon, the fleet anchored safely before
POrt Elsinburg, which was found in ruins and deserted.
Here Stuvvesant consumed several davs in reviewing his
fleet and in dividing it into five sections, each under iLi&gt; own
colors. By Friday morning, between eight and nine o'clock,
the expedition was landed above Fort Trinity, within gun-
shot. Stuyvesant immediately despatched Captain-lieutenant
Derek Smidt with a drummer to demand the surrender of
the fort. Swen Schute, the commander, requested time to
communicate with Rysingh, but was not accorded the privi-
lege* Meanwhile, the Dutch cut off communication between
Fort Trinity and Fort Christina, and the Swedes were ag^in
summoned to surrender. At Schute's request a parley was
granted, and the representatives of the two forces met ^in
the valley midway between the fort and the Dutch battery."
Nothing came of the interview, and the third and last order

112 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND

to surrender was given. Anothc r delay was requested and
granted, the Dutch batter)' construction not being sufiiciendy
far advanced to proceed with the attack.

The next morning, September iith, the Swedish com-
mander, seeing the tolly of further resistance, went on board
the Balance^ upon which was Stuyvesant, and capitulated.
The terms of the capituiation were liberal. The com-
maiuk r was permitted to remove all the artillery of the
crowii at his pleasure; twelve men, with coltjrs fl\ini:^ and
with their full arms and accoutrements, were permitted to
march out with the commander as his life guard, but the
rest only with their side arms \ and the commander and
his officers were to retain their personal property. About
noon the Dutch troops marched into the fort* About thirty
Swedes took the oath of allegiance to New Netherland
prescribed by Stuyvesant and asked leave to move to New
Amsterdam. The next day being Sunday, Dominie Mega*
polensis preached a sermon of thanksgiving to the *^army
of occupation."

The capture of Fort Trinity was accomplished with so
little noise that the event was not known to Rysingh at
Fort Christina until the day after the event occurred. In
fiiCt, out of nine or ten of his best men who had been sent
to reinforce Schute all except two were captured by the
Dutch advance guard. Van Elswyck was now sent to per-
suade Stuyvesant not to move on Fort Christina, but without
success. Rysingh, now realizing that Fort Christina was
to be attacked, employed all his forces during the night to
strengthen his position. On the following morning, the
Dutch threw up a battery and intrenched themselves on
the opposite bank of Christina Creek. Bv the i 5th they had
invested the fort on all sides. The fleet was tlien brought
into the mouth of the creek and cannon was mounted
in strategic places. Stuyvesant then commanded Rysingh
** either to evacuate the country, or to remain there imder
Dutch protection." The Swedish commai^der stoutly re-
fused tu do either. But he could not hold out long against

so superior a ibice. His powder was practically cathausted
and he had but thirty men for the defence. In the mean-
tune, the Dutch troops were pillaging the Swedes who lived
outside the fort, and, to add to his trouble, Rysingh's own
gurrison began to show signs of mutinj. Most of them
were worn out by constant watching, some were sick; there
had been some desertions, and Stuvvesant threatened to
gi^e them no quarter if they stubbornly held out much
longer. Twentv-tour hours were allowed in which to
capitulate. This occurred on the 25th of September, after
a siecre of fourteen davs. The Swedes marched out "with
their arms, colors fl) ing, matches lighted, drums beating,
and fifes playing.** The Dutch then took possession
of the fort, haukd down the bwcdiili ila^^, and hoisted
their own.

The terms of the capitulation permitted all Swedes who
desired to leave the countiy to do so, and the Dutch were
to furnish the means of transportation. Those who de-
sired to remain would be protected in their ^ persons, prop-
erty, or conscience." Permission was given to Rysingh and
Van Ebwyck to land either in France or England. Stuy-
vesant lent the former three hundred pounds, Flemish, to
be repaid within six months at Amsterdam — the property
of the crown and Company being held as security.

Immediately after the surrender, Stuyvesant, following
out his instructions, offered to return the fort to Rysingh
on certain "honorable and fair conditions." Rysingh, how-
ever, declined the offer. The Dutch were accused of com-
mitting many outrages on the inhabitants after the fall of
the fort. There is considerable evidence to support this
contention. In one of Rysingh's remonstrances to Stuy-
vesant, he says " women were violently torn from their
houses, whole buildings were destroyed ; thai oxen, cows
and swine, and other creatures were butchered, the horses
wantonly shot, the plantations destroyed, and the whole
countiy was left so desolate that scarce any means re-
mained for the subsistence of the inhabitants." He is

supported in this statement by AcrcHn&lt;?. A Dutch moh
attacked Rysineh him55elf and stole most of his private
property. 1 Ik rr is no evidence to show that these atrocities
were cununiLted with the connivance or even the knowledge
of Stuyvesant.

Rysingh and Van Elsvvyck were conveyed to Manhattan
in the Balance. Later, they were sent to Europe and landed
in England, where they gave the Swedish minister the first
information of the oveitbrow of the Swednh power on the
Delaware, In New Amsterdam a long and heated corre-
spondence was carried on between Rysingh and Stuyvesant*
The fonner claimed that Stuyvesan't broke the terms of
capitulation in several important particulars. On Stuyve-
sant's departure for Manhattan, Captain Derek Smidt was
temporarily placed in command of the Dutch interests on
South River, Later, November aQth, John Paul JacqueC
was given a commission as permanent viceniirector.

Thus fell New Sweden, the immediate result of a rash
act of an injudicious governor. Had Rysingh not attacked
Fort Casimir in disobedience to the express instructions of
his government, the Swedish power might have been pro-
longed for a time longer. In the end, ho\ve\er, it was
doomed to give way to the far superior forces of the Dutch
or tl;c Knglish. In 1656, the States General and Sweden
made the conquest a matter of international negotiations.
The Swedes protested against the Dutch aggression, but in
the end the matter was dropped. In the same year the
interests of lIk West Inuia Company on South River were
sold to the city of Amsterdam. The colony of New
Amstel was erected and control passed from New Nether-
land. For seventeen years the Dutch and the Swedes had
occupied the river jointly. Such, however, had been their
jealousies arising, from a mutual thirst for power" that the_
country had made little or no advance* The Swedes had
made more progress than the Dutch, notwithstanding the
neglect of the mother country, but it was not whax it should
have been even under the circumstances. The clash between

the three nationalities, Dutch, Swedes, and English, in one
of Ac three great river valleys of the East, resulted in the
complete victory of the Dutch over the Swedes. The scene
of the next conflict will be North River, and in place of
the Swedes the Dutch will have as opponents the far more
powerful English.

EHGUSB CONS^Smr OF MBIT NBTHERLANIK

1 Hi: passage of the first Navigation Act, in October,
1651, by the English Parhament nuLrkcd a change in the
English cuinmerciaJ policy th.it w -ls proUuctivc of momen-
tous results. It brought about an estrangement between
England and her North American colonies that led event*
ually to the inckpendence of thirteen of the latter. It
broun^ about alto an estrangement between Eng^^I and
her ancient friend and ally, HoUand, that resulted in the niin
of die Dutch naval and commercial power and the estab*
lidiment of the supremacy of that of Eng^d.

Bj the middle of the seventeenth centuiy the Dutch en-
joyeA the greater part of the carrying trade between Europe
and the West Indies, and Holland had become the com*
mcrcial centre of Europe* Three-fourths of the carrying
trade of England was done in Dutch bottoms and by Dutch
sailors. The commerce of Holland followed the tricolored
flag of the United Provinces over even' sea. Her colonial
outposts were scattered throughout Asia, Africa, and Amer-
ica, England witnessed this marvellous growth of Dutch
trade, and was filled with jealousy and alarm upon comparing
it with the rapid decay of her own. "Already her ships
began to lie idle at her quays, and her mariners to seek
employment in the vessels of the Dutch." Even while the
negotiations w ith St. John were being carried on, the States
General concluded a commercial treaty with Denmark which

was very much opposed to the best commercial interests
of England. Then, again, after tbr triumph of the Parlia-
mentary cause over the personal rule of the Stuarts, many
royalists had found refuge in Virginia, Barbadoes, and other
West Indian settlements. Thus it happened that after the
rest of the dependencies of England had been brought to a
recognition of the new government, the white population
of these other ct)Ionies mitrht be said to have been in a
state of open rebellion. Barbadoes had, for example, actually
received Lord Willoughby as governor under a commission
from Charles II., who was at that time a fugitive in Holland.
It went so far as to proclaun Charles king.

It was thus largely by reason of these circumstances,
taken advantage of by persons wishing to injure Cromwell
through die expense of a foreign war or to revenge them-
selves for slights and injuries received at the hands of the
Dutch, that Parliament passed the Trade and Navigation
Act. The act decreed that no merchandise of Asia, Africa,
or America should he imported into England or any of her
dependencies except in English-built ships, belonging either
to English or English-colonial subjects. Furthermore, that
the ships must have English commanders and be manned by
crews three-fourths of whom, at least, were English. It
was further decreed that no products of Europe should be
brought to England, unless in English vessels or in those
of the country in which the imponed cargoes were pro-
duced. This act was also accompanied by the issuance of •
letters of reprisal to some English merchants who considered
themselves aggrieved by the Dutch.

These measures affected the Dutch with particular sever-
ity, and one of the consequences was undoubtedly the war
with Flolland that broke out the year following. Their
immediate effect was the lopping ofF nf one of the principal
sourcrs of Dutch commercial supremacy and the capture
of eigiiiy Dutch ships as prizes. The Dutch were now as
eager to court English friendship as a few months before
they had been disinclined to accept it. In the following

December they sent ambassadors to the English Common-
wealth to protest against these hostile measures. They were
instructed, lil^ewise, to propose a treaty providing for a free
trade to the West Indies and Virginia and for a settlement
of the boundaries between the English and Dutch colonies
in America. Neither of these propositions was acceptable
to England. The Dutch had forbidden the English to
trade with the Dutch colonies^ and now the Dutch were
prohibited from engaging in trade with the English colonies*
With regard to the colonial boundary proposition, the very
ominous reply was made that the English had been the " first
planters of the northern continent of America," and now
had settlements from the "^southernmost part of Virfjinia,
in 37° N. Lat., to New Foundiand in 52°." The Kngiish
maintained very nai'vely, furthermore, that they knew of no
plantations of the Dutch within those bounds except a
small number on Hudson River. Consequently, they were
convinced that it was not necessary at the present time to
settle the boundaries, but that it might be done at a more
convenient time in the future. The English did, how-
ever, offer to reopen the necotiatums on a basis of fiec
trade on both sides. But the Dutch ambassadors were
not instructed to offer reciprocal trade. Holland was ham-
pered by two enormous commercial monopolies, and to
these was intrusted the government of her colonies. The
West India Company controlled New Netherland and, of
course, was not inclined to support a proposition that would
dispossess her of valuable privileges. The negotiations
consequently proved fruitless^ and the ambassadors were
recalled.

The two nations soon came to blows. Even while the
negotiations were still pending. Van Tromp encountered the
British fleet under Blake in the Downs, and a bloody but
indecisive battle followed. This led to a declaration of war
on July 8, 1652. A series of brilliant naval engagements
followed. For some time neither nation seemed to have
the advantage. Van Tromp, defeated by Blake, gave way



120



MIDDLM STATES AND MARTLAND



to De Ruytcr, but was later reinstated in command. Van
Ti omp then defeated iiiakc off the Naze, Nmcixiber 28th,
and cruised the Channel with a broom at his mast head im-
plying that he had swept the i:.nglish from the seas. But
his exultation was premature. The next year (1653) saw
Blake able to fight a drawn battle of two daya* duration, and
June 3d of that year saw the complete defeat of the Dutch
adnural. The next year witnessed the death of Van Tromp
and the complete ruin of the naval power of Holland* The
Dutch merchant shipping likewise had suffered so severely
that the States were driven to treat for peace. Cromwell, .
who had recently turned out the Long Parliament, was very
glad to close a war between two Protestant powers that had
so many things in common. The treaty was signed in
1654, and Denmark, the Hanseatic towns, and the Swiss
provinces were parties to it. The supremacy of the Eng-
lish flag in the British sea^ was recognized ; the Navigation
Act was accepted; ani tiie infant Prince of Orange was
excluded from the stadhokiership.

While all the United Provinces were in a state of turmoil
as a result of the war with the English Commonwealth, the
States General did not neglect to take precautions for the
protection of New Netherland. Stuyvesant was instructed
to keep a careful watch over the English colonies. l&gt;y
reason of the superior power of the English in America it
was deemed impolitic to precipitate actual hostilities. BroOs
with the people of New £ngland were to be studiously
avoided, and dieir friendship, particularly that of the English
of Virginia, was to be carefully cultivated. If, however.
New Eng^nd was determined to fight and should precipitate
hostilities, then the aid of the Indians was to be solicited
and any other means of defence was to be employed. Never-
theless, as a measure of precaution, Stuyvesant was instructed
to arm and drill all freemen, soldiers, and sailors ; to appoint
officers and places of rendezvous; to get together a supply
of munitions of war; and to inspect the fortifications at
New Amsterdam, Fort Orange, and Fort Casimir. Proper

military precautions were not neglected on Manhattan. A
wall was built across the island at the northern limit of the
city to keep out hostile forces landing at the north. This
was the beginning of the Wall Street of to-day. A line of
round palisades, six inches in diameter and twelve feet in
height, was also constructed. It was backed by a sloping
earthwork four feet in height.

The news of the war created but little less excitement in
New England than it had created in New Netherland. All
wondered what policy the Dutch would pursue in America.
The Puritan colonies sympathized with Parliament and had
very vaguely defined ideas of an annexation of New Nether-
land. Stuyvesant saw the danger, and to counteract their
schemes put himself in communication with the govern-
ments of New England and Virginia. He expressed the
friendly feelings of the West India Company and of the
authorities of New Netherland, and proposed that peace
should be maintained in spite of the war between their
mother countries. The governors of Connecticut and New
Haven were never very friendly to Stuyvesant. This very
poorly concealed hostility on the part of the two New
En^rland colonies, aggravated by the European war and the
domestic troubles at New Amsterdam, made Stuyvesant's
position at this crisis a most precarious one indeed. To
appreciate fully his troubles with New NeLhcrland, it will
be advisable to take up the thread of the narrative of his
domestic troubles at the point we left oflF in the preceding
chapter. After that has been done, the account of the diffi-
culties with New England may be continued until their
climax in the English conquest of New Netherland in 1664.

Stuyvesant found his troubles at New Amsterdam as
vexatious as those upon South River. His choleric tempera-
ment and exaggerated view of the importance of his official
position led him into constant quarrels. No sooner was he
free from one than another claimed his energies. The
Kuyter-Melyn affair was hardly disposed of when he found
himself involved in a quarrel with the Nine Men. Troubles

bad been accumulating some time before tbey reacbed a
climax. Kieft bad foiled to collect debts due to tbe Company
to tbe extent of thirty thousand guilders. Stuyvesant caused
distress by suddenly demanding payment. On the other
hand, the people complained that their own claims for wages
and grain against the Company had not been paid. Stuyve-
sant's commercial policy was unwise, and his usual method
of punishment when attempts were made to evade the high
customs duties was confiscation of goods. This resulted in
popular discontent in Holland and an avoidance of Man-
hattan as a port of entry by ships engaged in the West India
trade. There so much complaint, that the Nine Men
were obliged to intertere. They determined to send a dele-
gation to Holland, who should represent truthfully the con-
dition of the colony and ask for certain very much needed
reforms. They were encouraged in this determination by
Melyn*s success, which showcJ l onclusively that the States
General was willing to listen to the cuiumi&gt;Ls and was desirous
of affording them encouragement.

Stuyvesant at first commended the project strongly, but
it soon appeared that his commendation was based on the
understanding that the whole proceedings should be in his
name. To this the Nine Men would not assent. They
then requested the privilege of presenting the matter to the
people. When this privilege in turn was denied, several
leaders of the popular party took the liberty of going from
house to house to get an expression of opinion. From this
time," wrote a contemporary, "the breast of the Director
General became inflamed with rage " against all who were
concerned in the affair, although they were esteemed as
" honestest, fittest, most experienced, and most godly in the
community.'* Intrigues were set on foot to divide the popu-
lar party, and prosecutions were begun against some of the
more prominent of the leaders.

The Nine Men were not to be bullied in this manner.
They were led in their determination to take a bold stand
in defence of the rights of the people by Adrian van der

Donck, a member of the Council and formerly SheriiF of
Rensselaerwyck. To Van der Donck was asn^ed the task
of keeping a journal of events piepaiatory to drawing up a
remonstrance. Stuyvesant, learning of this, seized Van der
Donck's papers and had him thrown into prison. He was
accused of conduct tending to bring the sovereign authority
into contempt. After a stormy session of a council of
Stuyvesant*s own choosing, Van der Donck was expelled
from the Council. The vice-director. Van Dincklag^n,
alone opposed this action.

Van der Donck now became a political martyr, and Stuy-
vesant*s persecution of him only confirmed the Nine Men in
their determination to obtain a redress of their grievances
from the States General. They prepared a memorial asking
for three things : hrst, that the States General should assume
the direct government of New Netherland; secondly, that
it should give New Amsterdam a suitable municipal gov-
ernment; thirdly, that it should determine the boundaries
of New Netherland so that the people might dwell in
peace and quietness, and enjoy their liberty, as well in the
trade and commerce as in intercourse and settled limits."
They pointed to the government of New England as a
good example to be followed, and asked that the franchise
enjoyed in Holland should be enjoyed in New Netherland
and that the government of the provinces should resemble
the 'laudable government" of their fatherland.

This memorial and an accompanying remonstrance appear
to have been drawn up b)- Van der Donck, and were signed
by the Nine Men on July 26, 1649. Van der Donck and
two others were chosen to go to The Hague to present
the popular cause. A fortnight before their departure, Cor-
nelius '.Ttn Tirnhnvcn, the secretary of the province, set sail
for the same destination as the personal representative of
the director. Wishing to avoid the scene of Kieft*s ship-
wreck, his vessel sailed by the way of the north of Ireland.
The ship containing the popular delegates, on the contrary,
took a direct course and reached Holland first, much to the

chagrin of Van Tienlioven. Once there, their efforts were
seconded by Cornelius Melyn, Wouter van Twiller, and
Dominie Backarus, the lately resigned successor of Dominie
Bogardus. Sixty-eight specifications were submitted to the
States General of excessive and most prejudicial neglect"
on the part of the Company. On April II, 1650, a com-
mittee of the States General reported a provisional order for
the settlement of the whole controversy. Stuyvesant was
condemned for bringing on the disastrous Indian war, and
was forbidden to begin hostilities with the Indians or with
the English without the authority of the States General.
No arms or ammunition were to be sold to the Indians,
and the inhabitants were to be enrolled as a militia. Three
clergymen and several good schoolmasters were to be pro-
vided for the prov ince. The commonalty was to be con-
voiced for the purpose of selecting two members of the
Council. The machinery of taxation was to be determined
by the cornnidiialtv.

"^I he States General was not inclined to oppose the West
India Company to the extent of assuming the government
of New Netheriand. Consequently the first article of the
Nine Men's petition was not granted. As to the second
article, there was no objection to New Amsterdam's setting
up a municipal government, with a schout, two buigo-
masters, and five scbepens. Stuyvesant was to be called to
Holland to gjve an account of his conduct. As to the third
article, there was no objection to a commission for settling
boundaries.

The Amsterdam Chamber opposed this provisional order
in every particular, and it was referred back to the com-
mittee. Stuyvesant was thus encouraged by the Company to
continue his arbitrary acts. Vice-director Van Dincklagen,

for opposition to the policy of Stuyvesant, was expelled from
the Council, arrested, and imprisoned for sevcr:il cb\ s. The
Nine Men were forbidden the use of the pew assigned to
them by the consistory of the church. When any vacancy
occurred in their body, Stuyvesant refused to allow it to be

filled. Several dmes the Nine petitioned the States General
anew — once September 13, 1650^ and again December 22d
of the same year* Finally, in 1652, largely as a result of
the opposition of the other Dutch Chambers to Amsterdam's
g^eed, the export duty on tobacco was removed, the impor-
tation of slaves from Africa was permitted, the chaiges for
emigmnt passages reduced, and a burgher government was
conceded to New Amsterdam. This municipal government
was to be as nearly like that of the city of Amsterdam as
possible. As a matter of fact, however, Stuyve'sant retained
in his own hands the appointment of the schout, burp:o-
master, and schcpens, and contintied to claim the right to
make binding ordinances and interdicts issued on his own
personal responsibility. It was not until February 2, 1653,
that Stuyvesant issued a proclamation making effective the
instructions of the Amsterdam Chamber to set up a munici-
pal government. The same year, the States General re-
called StuyvesaiU, ordering him to proceed Lo Huilaod to
render an account of his administration. The Amsterdam
Chamber was amazed at this recall and succeeded in having
it revoked. Hostilities with England were fast approaching
and an experienced soldier was needed at New Amsterdam.

In these bitter disputes with his own countrymen, Stuy-
vesant was strenuously supported by the English residents*
As early as 1649 they had been employed in the interests
of the ctirector and his Council to counteract the demands of
the people for a more liberal government. The English
residents of Long Island were among those most active in
the support of the administration. They were to a large
extent under the political domination of Geoige Baxter, of
Gravesend, who was Stuyvesant*s English secretary of state.
When Secretary Van Tienhoven, as Stuyvesant*s personal
representative, was sent to Holland, in 1649, to oppose the
popular delegates in their appeal to the States General, he
carried with him amass of exculpatory documents. Among
these was a letter to the Amsterdam Chamber from the
ooagistrates of the English settlement at Gravesend. In it



126 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



they declared their confidence in Stuyvesant's wisdom and
justice in the administiation of the commonweal." The
very next year, another letter signed by Baxter and the
magistrates at Gravesend was addressed to the Amsterdam
Chamber. It was even more submissive than the other.
They "thankfully** acknowledged the benefits which they
had enjoyed under the rule of the Company, who, they as-
sertedy was the "rightful owner of this place.*' Further-
more, that the delegates who had returned from Holland
were given up to "schisms, factions, and intestine commo-
tions.** That this could best be prevented "by supporting
and maintaining our present governor against these malig-
nants, and by our superiors in Holland discrediting the false
reports of discontented persons.** A third letter, dated
September 14, 1051, from the magistrates at Gravesend
and Hempstead, and signed by the ever faithful Baxter,
breathed the same sy cophantic spirit as the other two. They
opposed any change wliatever being made in the government
of the province; they believed in the desirableness of a
strongly centralized government; and they opposed a popu-
lar election of the governor, which they conceived would
bring anarchy and ruin down upon all. Stuyvesant thus
found himself in the most extraordinary position of depend-
ing upon his alien subjects for support while nine-tenths of
his own countrymen were bitterly opposed to him. This
extraordinary condition of afliairs tended only to aggravate
matters, for it gave moral support to the Company in its
continued opposition to the spirit of popular freedom among
the Dutch colonists. Van der Donck expressed very aptly the
consensus of opinion with respect to Stuyvesant when he
wrote : " Our great Muscovy duke keeps on as of old — some-
thing like the wolf, the longer he lives, the worse he bites.'*
Stuyvesant was to reap retributive justice, however, at the
hnnHs of these very English subjects of Long Island within
less than two years. Toward the latter part of November,
1653, when provincial affairs were in a most criciml situa-
tion, the English of Long Island showed strong symptoms

of tiisatFection. liulland wds engaged in ;i w ar with England,
and Cromwell was threatening an atuck upun New Nether-
land in conjunction with the New England Confederation.
Stuyvesant's treasury was bankrupt, the fort was in a dilapi-
dated condition, and his Dutch subjects were disaffected.
Tbe buighers of New Amsterdam would not agree to past
the ordimuices necessary for the defence of the city untiT
Stujrvesant should agiee to their denundt for certain mu-
nicipal reforms. He succeeded in setting matters right by
surrendering to the city the excises upon liquors consumed
within New Amsterdam. This was &lt;k&gt;ne on condition that
the burghers and schepens should furnish subsidies for the
maintenance of the city woiicS) and for the support of the
civO and ecdestastical officers.

These concessions were not granted, however, before the
disaficction had spread to Long Island. The West India
Company, fearing treachery among the £nglish alien resi-
dents during the war with £ngland, instructed Scuyvesant
to appoint none but Dutchmen to the public offices. Not-
withstanding the sycophantic letters to the Amsterdam
Chaunber, Gravesend was now foremost in opposing the
provincial government. As before, Gravesend was under
the Influence of George Baxter, the former confidential agent
of Stuyvesant and one of the Dutch arbiters in the treaty of
Hartford. He and the Gravesend men were now just as much
opposed to a " strongly centralized government '* as formerly
thev had supported it. They now stood in dread of" tyranny
more and feared anarchy less.*' For the expression of such
treasonable thoughts, they had on the former occasion called
the Dutch **malignants."

The Long Island colonists had suffered numerous losses
from the Indians and from pirates. 1 his moved them in
the summer of 1653 to take some measures for their secu-
rity. Several minor meetings led finallv to a popular con\ en-
tion, or iandila^^ at New Amsterdam, December 10, 1653,
for the discussion of public affairs. It was the most im-

Amfterdain. Stiqrretsuit at fint opposed the meedng, but
was infonned that it would take place, and ^he mig^t do as
he pleased and prevent it if he could." He consequently
made the best of it and gave a reluctant sanction to what
he could not prevent. The conduct of the English dele-
gates in a fonnsr meeting, he sud, ^smdt of rebellion, of
contempt of his hig^ authority and commission." Of the
towns participating in this convention, four were Dutch and
four English, the former being represented by ten Dutch
and the latter by nine £ngUsh delegates. To Baxter, who
had had experience in preparing Stale papers, was given the
duty of drawing up the remonstrance. After a loyal pre£ice
in which the authority of the States General and the West
India Company was distinctly recognized, the remonstrance
grouped the grievances of the people under six heads: first,
the fear of the establishment of an arbitrary' governments
secondly, the belief that the people must look after their own
defence against the Indians, the protection afforded by the
provincial government being grossly inadequate; thirdly,
the appointment of officers and magistrates without the con-
sent or nomination of the people, quite roiiLrary to the laws
of the Netherlands; tnurthly, the unreasonable enforce-
ment of long forgotten orders and proclamations of the
director and Council, made originally without the knowl-
edge or consent of the people, and now raked up for i\\c
"confusion and punishment" of those who could not be
supposi d to know them ; fifthly, the neglect to make promised
grants nfi the faith of which large improvements had been
made, thus creating the suspicion that innovations were in
contemp'liition t l iferent from former stipulauons ; sixthlv,
the granting of tracts of land to favored individuals,

to the great injury of the province.

The nineteen delegates signed this remonstrance. It was
then sent to Stuy vesant widi the request that he " answer
on each point or article, in such wise" as to afibrd satls&amp;c-
rion, or to make it possible to proceed further as "God
shall direct our steps." This remonstrance was a blow at

Stuy vesant. A categorical answer he did not return^ but
did vouchsafe a long reply bristling with sarcastic remarks
and weired down by evasions, subterfuges, and insidious
attempts to create national prejudices. He held that
Breukelen, Midwout, and Amersfoort were without juris-
diction and had no right to send delegates to a popular
convention. That the other members were a few unquali^
fied delegates who had no right to address the director or
anybody else. That the colonies of Manhattan, Rensse-
laerwyck, Staten Island, and the settlements of Beverwyck
and South River had been too sensible and prudent to
"subscribe to all that had been projected by an English-
man." In fact, he did not beiicN e George Baxter himself
understood what he meant. What did they know about
arbitrary government? "If their rule were to become a
cynosure — if the nomination and electioji of magistrates
were to be left to the populace, who were the most inter-
ested, then each would vote for one of his own stamp-— the
thief for a thief ; the rogue, the tippler, the smuggler, for a
brother in iniquity, that he might enjoy greater latitude in
his vices and frauds."

The delegates were not to be silenced by this tirade. In
a rejoinder, they appealed to the ^Law of Nature" which
permits all men to assemble for the protection of their
liberties and their property. They asserted, furthermore,
that unless the director answered categorically the six points
of their remonstrance, they would appeal to the States
General and the West India Company.

The old general's wrath now waxed hot. He held the
act of the convention ^ smelt of rebellion," and ordered
the delegates to disperse on pain of his highest displeasure.
What had the "Law of Nature" to do with public meet-
ings for the protection of pubhc liberty! only muLnstrates,
not conimon people, had a right thus to assemble. "We
derive our authority from God and the Company, not from a
few ignorant subjects, and we alone can call the inhabitants
together." This was Stuyvesant's farewell slap.

The popular voice, however, was not to be stifled without
a protest. I^etters were addressed to the West India Com-
pany by the buigoniasters and schepens of New Amsterdam,
by the magistrates of Giavesend, and hj Baxter and others,
explaining the unhappy state of affiura. They were in-
trusted to Francois le Bleeuw, an advocate, who proceeded
to HoUand with instructions to use every legitimate means
to procure the reforms*' demanded by the people. The
mission was a total (ailure, and Le Bleeuw was forbidden
to return to New Netheriand. In a letter dated May i8,
1654, the West India Company emphatically approved
Stuyvesant's conduct. We are unable to discover in the
whole remonstrance," they wrote, **one single point to
justify complaint. You ought to have acted with moie
vigor against the ringleaders of the g^uig, and not have
condescen di I to answer protest with protests, and then to
have passed all by without further notice." Stuyvcsant
was ordered to punish the ringleaders for the purpose of
deterring others from following thdr example. He was to
punish the Gravesend rabble summarily and in a most ex-
emplar}' manner. The burgomasters and schepens of New
Amsterdam were charged to conduct themselves " qiiietlv
and peaceably" and to submit Themselves to the government
placed over them; to hold no pariu ular convention" with
the English on matters of State which did not concern
them ; or worse, to attempt an ^alteration in the state and
its government.**

Following out these instructions, Stuyvesant removed
from the magistracy George Baxter and James Hubbard,
\v iio had sat in the convention as delegates from Gravesend.
This town had now become notoriously disaffected. Many
English residents of Long Island, in fact, began to muLici
threats of mutiny. The report was spread early in 1655
by Baxter, who had just returned from New England, that
the Protector had ordered the taking of the island from the
Dutch by force if necessary. This gave Baxter and Hub-
bard the opportunity for which they had been looking. They

hoisted tbe English flag at Gnvesend, and read a seditbtis
paper in which they declared that ^we, as freebom British
suhjects, claiin and assume to ourselves the laws of our
nation and Republic of England over the place, as to our
persons and property, in love and harmony, according to
the g^eral peacr between the two States in Europe and
this country." While they were engag^ in reading this
bit of interesting literature, a party of Stuyvesant's soldiers
appeared on the spot and arrested both Baxter and Hub-
iMird. They were taken to New Amsterdam and kept in
prison for nearly a year. Gravesend now became tranquil,
and Stuyvesant's triumph was complete. Thus failed for
the time being one of the earliest and most notable attempts
on the part of the people to gain a certain measure of
popular control in the atfairs of the province. Neverthe-
less, thr people continued to look forward to the time when
gover:i iiu :it by the people would cease to be a dream and
would become a realitv. In the meajitime, they had to con-
tent themselves with placing every obstacle in the way of a
tyrannical admmistration and with indulging the "hope of
obtaining English liberties by submitting to English juris-
diction.'*

England in its relation to the possession ot [he Dc iawarc,
which we have detailed from its inception down to the pre-
cipitate withdrawal from New Amstcid^ui ur ihv delegates

porary wrangles between the Dutch and the English of
Long Island and the Southern colonies. On the dissolution
of the Council for New England in 1635, Charles I. had
gnnted Long Ishmd to William Alescander, Earl of Stirling,
then Secretary of State for Scotland. Two attempts were
made by his agents to take possession of the islands—one
in 1637, and one in 1640, — 4&gt;ut both proved unsuccessful.
At the beginning of Stuyvesant's administration in 1647,
Lord Stiiling^s widow made another attempt. She sent

completely taken aback by Fomster^t aieurance. He aoon
recovered his compotuie, howevefi and packed his opponent
off to Holland a prisoner, where he mig^ defend himself
if he could. But the ship put into an English port and
Forrester escaped. He did not return to America.

The next year, 1648, Sir Edmund Plowden, the titular
Ear! l^ilatine of New Albion, p;iid a second visit to Man-
hattan. His first visit had been inatie in 1643, during the
administration oi kieft. He claimed most of the territory
between Cape May, Sandy Hook, and Delaware River,
under an absurd patent issued at Dublin by the Viceroy of
Ireland. Kieft had disregarded entirely Plowden*s claims,
and they were treated in no wise less contemptuously by
Stuyvesant. The \ leeroy of irciand had no authority what-
ever to grant territorial rights in America. Plowden had
been living in Virginia for seven yeart and had lott all
his property. He went to Boston from Manhattan and
thence to London. He did not return to wony StuyvetaAt
again, but aeemt to have been content with publishing a
pamphlet, Dismftkn rf tkt BmiKf tf Ntw Mkn^ in lieu
of actual possession of the same. Fendall's Maryland
daim was based upon more solid grounds than those of
Stirling and Plowden, and in another chapter will be given
the considerstion due it.

Stuyvesant realized the very great importance of a peace-
ful settlement of the boundary disputes with New England.
The Hartford Convention of 1650 had been planned to that
end. Of this treaty, with especial reference to South River,
we have spoken in a preceding chapter. It only remains to
speak of the treaty in its particular bearing upon the terri-
torial disputes between New Netherland and New England.
The board of arbitration speedily decided that the T.ong
Island boundary between the Dutch and Enghvh iunsdic-
tions should be a Une drawn from the extreme western part

of Oyster Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. On tbe mauiland
it was to extend from the west shore of Greenwich Bay^
about four miles from Stamford, north twenty miles — pro-
vided it did not run within ten miles of Hudson's Riven"
The Dutch were not to settle within six miles of the line,
and Greenwich was to be under Dutch jurisdiction. Both
sides of the Connecticut were decided to belong to the Eng-
lish, but the Dutch were to keep possession ot the lands
near Hartford actually in their possession or actually deter-
mined by metes and bounds.

By this treaty, Stuyvesant practically abandoned all claim
to New England territory. Open opposition to the treaty
developed in New Netherland. The fact that both of the
Dutch referees were Englishmen was considered an insult
or at least a slight. Complaints were sent to Holland that
more territoiy had been surrendered than might have formed
fifty colonies. Van der Donck wrote: &lt;^ All the arbitrators
were English and they pulled the wool over the director's
eyes." " He never imagined that such hard pills would be
given him to digest,'' wrote another. ^^New England speaks
of him in terms of great praise, . . . because he hath
allowed himself to be entrapped by her courtesy.'* Stuy-
vesant himself, when he heard of the award, is said to have
exclaimed: "r\e been betrayed! I've been betrayed!" It
is a fact that, when he reported the negotiations to the
Amsterdam Chamber, he did not send a copy of the Hart-
ford treaty. A certified copy did not reach the Chainbtr
until 1656, when it was sent to the States General and
ratified on February 2 2d. The West India Company was
instructed to see to it that the treaty was ratified by Eng-
land. This was not done, and the matter remained in sus-
pense until the restoration of Charles 11. Although the
treaty was decidedly in the interests of New England as
against those of New Netherland, yet there is no doubt
but that Stuyvesant did the best he could under the circum-
stances. Had the treaty not been negotiated, it is altogether
probable that New Amsterdam would have fallen before

the advance of the English some time before 1664. The
ratiiication of the treaty is very good evidence that this view
of the situation was taken by both the States General and
the West India Company.

The treaty did not, however, prevent continued encroach-
ments upon Dutch territory by the English of Massachusettf
and Connecticut. In 1653, the En^ish seized Fort Good
Hope on the Connecticut, and six yean kter, 1659, Mas-
sachusetts attempted to make several settlements on the
banlcs of the Hudson* Both these acts were phinly direct
breaches of the Hartford Convention. The former event
is worthy of more than passing comment, inasmuch as it
marked practically the end of Dutch pretensions upon the
Connecticut.

The Dutch claim to Connecticut River was baaed upon
the navigation of that river as far as Hartford by Adrian
Block in 16 14. Dutch traders made their appeanuice there
in 1622, and in 1623 a small fort or trading post is said
to have been projected. No Dutch settlements were made,
however, and Fort Good Hope was not finished by Jacob
van Curler until June, 1633. Prior to this, however, in
1630, the territor}' 15 alleged to have been conveyed to Lord
Warwick by the Council for New England. He, in turn,
two years later, made grants to Lord Saye and Sele, Lord
Brooke, Saltonstall, and Winthrop. In 1635, English colo-
nists settled Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield. From
this date, the association of the Knj^lish and the Dutch on
the Connecticut became close, and disputes inevitably arose.

The climax was reached in 1654, when the cupidity of
Connecticut was finallv gratified by the formal capture
of Fort (}oud Hope. It had already been seized, July 7th,
the year before, by the eccentric John Underbill, who posted
a notice on the unoccupied fort declaring that he did so
"with the permission of the General Court of Hartford.**
Underbill's activity in collecting testimony in support of
charges against Stuvvesant had led to his arrest and brief
iniprisonmcm at New Amsterdam. On bis release he had

faised the P^liamentaiy flag at Hempstead and Fluahing
mnd was compelled to escape to New England. He secured
the equivalent of letters of marque from Providence Plan-
tations, giving him authority to capture Dutch vesaela.
Construijig his commission libeially, his first exploit was
the seizure of the fort* ^^Thus was the last vestige of
Dutch dominion in New England wiped out."

Two other causes of irritation between the Dutch and
English colonists were the onerous customs regulations of
New Ncthcrland and the attitude of both toward the In-
dians. At the beginning of Stuyvesant's administration, the
Cf &gt;mmissioners of the United Colonies had protested against
the Dutch traders selling guns and ammunition to the
Indians. Also, a complaint was made of the high duties im-
posed upon imports and exports. The colonial duties were
indeed injuriously lugh, and Stuyvcsant enforced them to the
letter. This led to an incident that was the cause of con-
siderable friction. Secretar)' Van Ticnhoven happened to
visit New Haven in 1647 and found there an Amsterdam
ship, the JJiHin/o. It had been trading for about a

month witlit iit a license from the West India Company as
required. 'l u o of the nw ;uts of the cargo applied for per-
mission to trade at Munliaitan, ui.d later the permission was
sent to New Haven. Stuyvesant learned in a mosi acci-
dental manner that the ship was to sail for Virginia. No
offer having been made to pay the proper duties, such action
cofistitttted an open violation of the colonial revenue laws.
Stujrvesant determined to seize the vessel. He despatched
a company of soldiers on board the Zwtliy a vessel recently
sold to some merchants of New Haven, under the pretext of
conveying it to the new owner. Instructions were g;iven to
capture the Sm BiidtM. The strategy was an entire success.
The vessel was seized in New Haven harbor ^on the Lord's
day" and brought direct to Manhattan and confiscated.

This bold act naturally caused great excitement in New
Haven. The people of diat place had tried to scop the ship,
but having been taken by surprise they made the attempt

too late. Eaton protested most vigorouslv against this out-
raLr anj retaliated bv taking into his service three of the
West India Company ^ delinquent servants who had fled
from Manliattan. At the same time he addressed a very
sharp letter to the viinctor, lecturing him for his shortcom-
ings, Stuyvesant resenttu u h^t \\c termed Eaton's ripping
up all my faults as if I were a schoolboy, and not one of
like degree with himself." This he followed up by issuing
in mm t recalinory prodimition pronusing a ssic domictfe
to slaves, debtors, and pritonen* *^If any person," nm tlie
proclamation, ^ooble or ignoble, fraeman or slave, debtor
or creditor, yea, to tbe lowest prisoner included, run awaj
from the colony of New Haven, or seek refuge in our
limits, he shall remain free, under our protection, on caking
the oath of allegiance." This impolitic act placed the
director in a false position both at home and abroad. His
own countrymen condemned it as tending to make New
Netheriand a refuge for criminals and vagabonds* The
Company deemed it unwise to give £ngland needless offence.
The proclamation was annulled the next year, 1648, after
the fugitives had returned to New Amsterdam on Stuyve-
sant*s personal promise to pardon them.

Sruvvesant and the commissioners nf the United Colonies
were almost constantlv in correspomli jicc about some fan-
cied or real iirirvance. In 1653, during the war between
England and Holland, Stuyvesant was accused of inciting
the Indian^ to iii.ikc a concerted attack upon the English.
He did nut wan iov the commissioners to act, bur nut the
accusations with a prompt and vigorous dtiual. Further-
more, he oiFcrcd to defend himself at Boston or at New
Amsterdam. The commissioners accordingly sent agents
to Manhattan, These agents behaved in a most undiplo-
matic manner — acting as inquisitors and seeking to collect
only evidence incriminating the Dutch. Stuyvesant kept
himself under wonderful control. He made five proposi-
tions that gave evidence of his desire to live in amity with
the New England colonists: first, netg|iborly friendship.

without regtrd to the hosdltties in Europe; secondlj, con-
tinuance of trade and commerce as before ; thirdly, mutual
justice against fnudulent debton; fourthly, a defensive and
offisntive alliance agsunat the enemies of both the Dutch
and English provinces; fifthly, the negotiation of these
points by Dutch plenipotentiaries with the conunissioneis
in case the agents lacked full and final poweis to act.

The New En^and agents, however, repelled Stuyvesant's
friendl V overtures, and, after issuing a defiant manifesto, left
New Amsterdam abruptly without assigning any reason
other than a desire to reach Boston in time for an election.
They Had ample time, nevertheless, on their way home to
stop at Flushing, Stamford, and New Haven to collect
hearsay evidence to sustain their charges against the New
Netherland authorities. On reaching Boston, they sub-
mitted their testimony and at the same tunc made certain
belligerent recommendations. Six out of eight of the com-
missioners were for instant war. Immediate iu snlities,
however, were averted by the refusal of Massachusetts to
engaec in war. For this attitude, Massachusetts was blamed
ruujidl) by Cuiinecticut and New Haven. Both these colo-
nies were bent on war and considered themselves strong
enough to subdue New Nctlicrlaiid without the aid of
Massachusetts. Excited meetings were held at Stamford
and Fairfield, volunteers were raised, and an appeal was
made to Oliver CiomwelL

Animosity was excited also in London hy the publication
of an in&amp;mous pamphlet entitled Tb^ Secmd Part tf tbt Am-^

purporting the total ruin and murder of all the English
cdonistt in New EngUnds and extiacted from the various
letters lately written from New England to di&amp;rent mer-
chants in London.** The Amsterdam Chamber immediately
issued a Dutch tnnslation of this pampUec, chamcterizing
it as an infamous, lying Hbel, at whidi the Devil in Hell

Cromwellf now Protector, seized upon this condition of
afiain as a good o'ppoitiiiii^ to make the move that he had
been contemplating for some tune* Thoiig|i negotiations for

peace with the United Provinces were in progress, he per-
mitted himself to be persuaded by the agents of New Haven
and Connecticut to send four ships of war to America.
This httle fleet, upon which two hundred soldiers were
embarked, was under the command of Major Rohen Sedg-
wick and Captain John Levcrctt. They carried instructions
authorizing them to call upon the governors of the New
England colonies to join in ^^vindicating the ii^nglish right
and extirpating the Dutch.**

Cromwell's letters r«)used New England to action. Con-
necticut promised two hundred men, and even five hundred,
'Mather than the design should fail.** Plvmouth promised
to furnish fifty men, stating at the same time, however, that
it concurred in hostile measures against the Dutch only
in behalf uf the "nati(jnal (juarrel." In command uf their
forces, Plymouth placed Captain Miles Standish and Captain
Thomas Willett. The latter was one of Stuyvesant*s two
negotiators of the Hartford treaty. New Haven raised one
hundred and thirty-three men. Massachusetts, however, was
less xcalous, but did allow diree hundred volunteers to enlnt.
This would have made a total force of eight hundred and
eighty-three men, but Plymouth fiuled to furnish its quota in
time, thus reducing the number to eight hundred and thirty-
three. Stuyvesant could not cope with this force, and the
overthrow of New Netherland seemed to be at hand. The
director was full of apprehension. He did not believe even
the Dutch in the country districts would support him in
case of a sudden attack. His English subjects he knew
would take up arms against him and join the enemy, in spite
of the fact that they had swom allegiance. "To invite
them to aid us," he said, ^ would be bringing the Trojan
horse within our walls. What can we do^' he asked, ^we
have no gunners, no musketeers, no sailors, and scarcely
one thousand six hundred pounds of powder.*'

ENGUSH CONGEST OP HEW NSTHERUND 1 39

In the meantime, however, the peace negotiationt between
Holland and England had been bioii^t to a successful issue.
Just as Sedgwick's fleet was on the point of sailing from
Boston, news reached Boston and New Amsterdam that a
peace had been agreed upon. Inhere was joy at New Am-
sterdam. The hostile forces intended to conquer New
Netherland were diverted for the purpose of dislodging the
French from the coast of Maine. The 12th of August was
appointrd hv Stuvvcsant as a Any of gt-nrral thanksgiving.
He called upon the prn]ilc to praise the Lord, who had
secured their gates and blessed their possessions with peace,
even here, where rhe threatened torch ot' war was lighted,
where the waves reached our lips, and subsided only through
the povv( r of the Almighty." For ten years longer, New
Netherland was to remain under the sovereignty of the
Dutch.

The events were already occurring that were to lead ulti-
mately to the overthrow of Dutch power in America. On
the 3d of September, 1658, Oliver Cromwell died and the
reins of government fell quietly into the weak hands of
his eldest son^ Richard. It was very evident to all that the
restoration of the Stuarts was near at hand. But the resto-
ration of Charles II. did not produce in England more
friendly feeling toward the Dutch. Although Charles was
entertained magnificently at The Hague on his way from
Breda to London, and although he swore lasting friendship
for Holland, yet the English Parliament took the first oppor-
tunity to make still more obnoxious the Navigation Act of
1 65 1. The two nations had become commercial rivals,
and it soon became evident to the Dutch that another crisis
was near at hand and that little more could be expected
from Charles than from the Protector.

One f)f Charles's hrst acts affecting colonial affairs was
the granting of a most liberal charter to Connecticut. This
charter annexed New Ha\en to Con?iccticut and simply
ignored the existence of New Netheilaiid. At the tune of
the Restoration it was clear to some of the shrewdest of the

English ftatetmen that the nKsmcnt for the employment of
a ftronger colonial policy had arrived. The colonies were
ordered to carefully and £uthfully execute" the Navigation
Act. The colonies antweied that this could not be done
so long as the Dutch were in control of New Netherland.
The Dutch possessions were central and separated the
English possessions like a wedge. The New England
colonists coveted the lucrative fur trade of the Hudson.
Furthermore, control of the region was necessary for the
military command of the eastern part of the continent. Ail
these arguments were presented to Charles by busy intriguers
with the ardor horn of inuividual interest.

Connecticut now hegan to plan tor the acquirement of
all of the rights and privileges granted by its new charter.
The West liuiia Company sau cli arly the trend ot arfairs,
and ini.Li uctcd Stuyvesaiu to cticct, if possible, a dtUnite
settlement with Connecticut. The director accordingly
visited Boston and appeared before the commissioners of the
United Cokaniet. Stuy vesant wis completely baffled in his
attempt, and the confinence ended without the accomptish-
ment of the object desired. Stujrvesam next sent envmrt
to Haitford who inquiied: **If Connecticut extends to the
F^ific Ocean, where lies New Netherhmd ? " The Hart-
ford men replied moat nonchalantly: We know not, unless
you can show us your charter." The conference thus
ended as unsatisfactorily as had the one in Boston. It was
perfectly plain to Stuyvesant that this attitude on the part
of Connecticut boded ill for New Netherland. He wrote
to the Company, asking that soldiers and supplies be sent,
otherwise, he said, we declare that it is wholly out of our
power to keep the sinking ship afloat any longer.**

Matters went frnm bad to worse. In 166-^, John Scott,
a bold adventurer, ainved in America and assumed the presi-
dcncv of a rebellious lpa(r'ie of Long Island towns including
Htsnpstead, Graveseiid, }• lushing, Oyster Bay, Middelburg,
and Jamaica. He had come over with letters of recom-
mendation from Charles to the New England governors.

his seizure of parts of Long Island. Affairs had now
reached such a critical state that Stuyvesant called a landdag
to meet April 10, 1664, to consider what should be done.
All realized that little could be done, and this gloomy view
of the state of afiairs was very shortly to be drastically
verified.

Charles II. now made up his mind to seize New Nether-
land. Lord Stirling's old patent to Long Island was pur-
chased for ;^3,5oo and the rights under it granted to the
king's brother, James, Duke of York. The paccnt covered
the whole of New Netherland and a part of Connecticut.
The duke lost no time in making good his pretensions. As
Lord High Admiral, he despatched a fleet of four ships with
about four hundred and fifty regular troopt with their
officers to take possession of New Netherland. The expe-
dition was intrusted to Colonel Richard Nicolls, who was
to be the duke's deputy governor after the Dutch posses-
sions were secured. The expedition had been organized in
deepest secrecy, lest Holland should be afforded the oppor-
tunity of sending a fleet to the defence of the province. In
spite of these precautions, however, Stuyvesant received in-
telligence of die expedition early in July* The governor
prepared as best he could. He was making satisfactory
headway with his defences, when news came from the West
India directors that there was no cause for apprehension,
that the fleet had been sent out for an entirelv different
purpose. Efforts were now relaxed, some warships about
to sail for Cura^oa were permitted to go, and Stuyvesant
left for Fort Orange.

There was sufficient truth in the report to help to lull
suspicions at New Amsterdam. The fleet reached New
England in julv, and the commissioners on board at once
demanded the iissistaace of Massachusetts in the project.
But the people of Massachusetts were "full of excuses,"
fearing that the overthrow of New Netherland would give
Charles a freer hand in putting down his enemies in New



MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



Enirland. Connecticut, on the other hand, was alacrity
itself and offered, without delay, her miHtarv forces.

News of. the final destination of the fleet was brought to
Stuyvesant while he was absent in the northern part of the
Dutch Lciiitory. He hurnediy rcturiicJ and made every
effort to redeem the precious time lost. But it was too late.
Within a few days after his arrival, the English squadron
sailed up the Lower Bay and anchored just below the Nar-
rows. A company of soldiers was sent ashore, and seized
the block house on Staten Island. The next morning,
Saturday, August 30, 1664, Stuyvesant was ordered to sur-
render. His cause was a hopeless one. He had only about
one hundred and fifty regular soldiers, and but two hundred
and fifty citizens capable of bearing arms, and many of these
were disaiFected. There were but twenty guns mounted
at Fort Amsterdam and the supply of powder was inade-
quate. Both river banks were defenceless. The ships of
the enemy carried at least one hundred and twenty guns and
there was a total of nearly one thousand men on board, but
Stuyvesant determined to make a stout resistance. He con-
sulted with his burgomasters and schepcns, but found them
strongly inclined to offer no resistance. Non-resistance
was, in fact, opcniv advocated. The demand on Rensselaer-
wyck for aid was answered by the statement that they had all
they could do to protect themselv es against immediate attack
by the Indians. The Dutch on Long Island refused aid,
saying they had their owii families and property to protect.

NicoUs now addressed a letter to Winthrop, authorizing
him to offer Stuyvesant in the king's name most favorable
conditions to all the inhabitants. Winthrop, who, with
other commissioners from New England, had joined the
English squadron, delivered this letter to Stuyvesant under
a flag of truce and urged him to surrender. Tliis he refused
to do, saying, ^^such a course would be disapproved in the
Fatherland — ^it would discourage the people." Nevertheless,
NicoUs's letter, when read to the Council and the burgo-
masters, produced a most favorable impression. The latter

requested that it be read to the citizent who were collected
in crowds outside the place of meeting, as ^all which re»
garded the public wel&amp;re oug|it to be nuule public/' Stuy-
▼esant refused to accede to this request, and on its being
doggedly insisted upon he angrily tore the letter in pieces.
The citizens then left their woric on the fortifications and
throu^ three of their representatives demanded the reading
of the letter. Complaints were now uttered against the
Company's misgovernment, and resistance was declared to
be idle. ^The letter 1 the letter!" was the general ciy.
Stujrvesant now saw that **to oftr resistance against so
many would be as idle as to gape before an oven." He
feared a mutiny and yielded. The fragments of the letter
were collected and a copy read to the people. It read as
follows:

**Mr. Winthrop:

"As to those particulars you spoke to me, I do assure
you that it the Manhadoes be deHvered up to his Mairstv,
I shall not hinder, but anv people from the Netherlands
may freelv come and plant there or thereabouts; and such
vessels of their own country may froelv come thither, and
any of them may as freely return lu&gt;me, in vessels of their
own country; and this and much more is containrd in the
privilege of his Majesty's English subjects; and thus murh
you may, by uliat means you please, assure the Governor
from, Sir, your very affectionate servant,

"Richard Nicolls.**

Stuyvesant's sceptre had now evidently departed from
him. There was nothing for him to do but to reply to
NicoUs's demand to surrender by a justification of the Dutch
title to New Netherland. But Nicolls was there not to
discuss titles, but to cany out instructions. ^ On Thurs-
day/' he saidy^I shall speak with you at the Manhattans."
In answer to a statement that he would he welcome if
he came as a friend^ he replied: shall come with ships

and soldiers. Hoist a white flag at the fort, and I laajr

consider your proposition."

It was now perfectly evident to Nicolls that Stuyvesant
was averse to surrender. As two ot the English ships passed
in front ot i^ ort Amsterdam, the old director stood on one
of the angles of the fort with an artilleryman at his side who
was prepared to fire at the foe at the word of command. "The
director seemed eager to give the order to fire. It is a heroic
picture, that does not fade from the mind easily. On the
request of Dominic Megapolensis, he did not give the com-
maiui. i lie people of the town were thruvvu into a panic
at the approach of the enemy. Stuyve&amp;ant was implored
to submit. *^He would rather be carried a corpse to his
grave," was his reply. He was now presented with a re-
monstiance su^ested by Dominie Megapolensis and signed
by ninety&lt;4faree of the leading citizens, among whom was
Bdthazar Stuyvesant, the director's own son.

Stuyvesant's position was akogjether hopeless. The enemy,
constantly reniforced by people from New En^and, pressed
upon him in front. At his rear were his own thoroughly
disaffected burghen. The fort could not withstand the
enemy three days at the longest. The city itself was
pmctically defenceless. The supply of powder would not
last a day, and the smrk- of provisions was equally low.
The soldiers were inclined to be mutinotis, and were heard
to say : Now we hope to pepper those devilish traders who
have so long salted us; we know where booty is to be
found, and wh rro the young women live who wear gold
chains." Surrender was the only course to adopt. Six repre-
sentatives each were appointed by Stuyvesant and Nicolls
and articles of capitulation were drawn up and agreed upon,
September 6, 1664. Thrv were signed by Nicolls imme-
diately, but Stuyvesant aivd his Council did not sign them
until the following Monday — two dav^ aftt r. There were
twenty-three articles in the capitulation. The only differ-
ence of opinion was respecting the Dutch soldiers, whom
the English refused to transport to Holland. The Dutdi

were to enjoy tecurity in their property and liberty of con-
science, and letain their inheritance customs and church
discipline. For the time being, the municipal officers of Man-
hattan were not to be changed. The town was to continue

to choose deputies, who were to have a free voice in all public
affairs. The enforcement of the Navigation Act was to be de-
In'.'cd six months, diirinjr \\ hich tune there was to he free in-
tercourse with Holland. Public records were to be respected.

Monday morning, September 8th, at eight o'clock, the
Dutch forces, led by Stuyvesant, marched out of Fort Am-
sterdam with all the honors of war and proceeded down
Beaver Lane to the landing, with drums beating, colors
flying, and matches lighted. At the same time, an English
corporal's guard occupied the vacated turt. Colonel Nicolls
and Sir Robert Carr, at the head of two companies of sol-
diers, entered the city, and Sir George Cartwrighi took
possession of die g^ttes and occupied the town hsJl. The
English flag was raised ahove Fort Amsterdam, and NicoUs
was prodaimcd deputy governor for the Duke of York hy
the burgomasters. The fort's name was changed to Fort
James, and the names of the city and province were changed
to New York — in compliment to the duke.

Fort Orange on North River and New Amstd on South
River surrendered next, after aU the privileges of the Arti-
cles of Capitulation had been promised Sieir defenders.
The name of the former was changed to Fort Albany,
after the Scottish title of the Duke of York. New Amstel
offered resistance to Sir Robert Carr, who was sent to accept
its capitulation. The fort was then stormed and plundered,
and three of the Dutch were killed and ten wounded. Carr
then broke cvcrv prnmi«;e he had made. The inhabitants
were plundered and the Dutch soldiers were sent "to be
sold as slaves in Virginia." The treaty with the Iroquois
was renewed and they were promised the same advantages as
they had been gi\ en by the Dutch. This alliance continued
practically unbroic^en until the beginning of the American
Revolution.

Thus came to an end the Dutch power in America.
The act of spoliation hy which it was accomplished is with-
out palliation. In time of profound peace and scarcciy
without warning the possessions of a friendly power were
violently seized. It was done at the direct instigation of
a king who, when a fugitive without a home and without a
country, was entertained most hospitably by the very nation
whose sovereignty he thus violated. However fortunate
this act of Charles II. ma\ be considered from the point of
view of subsequnu developments, it cannot he defended by
any rule of intri n itioiukl ethics — whether of the seventeenth
century or of the iwciuicth. O'Callaghan, quoting from
Butler^ savs: "In the his^ rv of tlu- royal ingrate hv whom
it was planned, and for whose benefit it was perpetrated,
there are few acts more base, none more characteristic."



CHAPTER VII



THE DUTCH UNDMR ENGUSU RULE^ 1664-168^

Regarded Irum the point of view of political morality,
history has but one voice — that of the severest condemna-
tion — in characterizing those unscrupulous schemers who
were directly instrumental in despuiling Holland of her pos-
sessions in North America. There were undoubtedly great
underlying causes, such as commercial jealousy and a desire
for territorial unification, that would have brought about
this same result in course of time. Nevertheless, the com-
mission of this act of spoliation would have been indefinitely
postponed had it not been for the malign influence of two
powerful individuals. To Sir George Downing and the
Duke of York belongs the discredit of having planned and
consummated this outrage. They planned it in secret
and accomplished it with a studied deceit toward a friendly
power. Through the prudence of Clarendon, England and
Holland had agreed upon a treaty of peace and alliance, Sep-
tember 4., 1662. These friendly relations might possibly
have continued had it not been for the " private interest and
private pique*' of the duke and Downinp^. The latter was
envoy at The Hague. O'Callaghan well describes Inm as
"keen, bold, subtle, active, and observant, but imperious
and unscrupulous, naturally preferring menace to persua-
sion, reckless of the means employed or the risk incurred
in the pursuit of a proposed object, disliking and distrusting
the Dutch, and forearmed with a fierce determination not to

H7



148 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



be foiled or overreached.'* The Duke of York had private
interests to subserve and a personal pique to avenge. As
Governor of the Royal African Company he was brought
into direct rivalry with the Dutch. Furthermore, by reason
of libellous remarks made about him in Holland, he disliked
the Dutch as much as did Downing.

Whatever may be said as to the political equities of the
conquest of New Netherlands there can be but unanimity
of opinion as to its importance to England. By this con-
quest England became the mistress of all the Atlantic coast
between Aradia and Florida. Furthermore, the navigation
laws of England, which could not be made ct^cctive in
America so long as Holland controlled so important a colony,
could now be enforced without hindrance.

The change of sovereignty did not retard the material
develojiment of the province. Nor did it curtail the popu-
lar privileges that had been wrested from the unwiJlmg
hands of Peter Stuyvesant. 1 lie terms of capitulation had
been extremely liberal, when we recall the fact that they
had been granted by a conqueror. The King of Eng-
land had merely resumed possession of a province occupied
and improved by a foreign people. The duke's policy was
to make the territory a paying investment. To accomplish
this it was necessary for him to prevail upon the inhabitants
to remain by ofiering them liberal inducements to do so.
These terms they accepted in good faith and quietly sub-
mitted to the change of rulers.

At the time of the conquest, according to Chevalier
Lambrechtsen, New Netherland consisted of three cities
and thirty villages. Exclusive of Indians its population was
about ten thousand souls, while that of New Amsterdam
was one thousand six hundred. The people of the province
enjoyed a fair measure of freedom and protection. There
were numerous flourishing farms, or bouweries. The Dutch
and their alien neighbors, on the whole, lived in harmony j
and, theoretically at least, a comparatively high standard
of justice was administered to all impartially. All were

fiurly adequately protected hy crnistitutional guaranties*
New Netheriand had welcomed from the earliest times the
oppressed of all nations. The knowledge of the traditional
Dutch policy of religjlous toleration drew many men of many
creeds and tongues to New Amsterdam, This policy, despite
the rule of the Company forbidding the setting up of any
church except the Dutch Reformed, had been carried out
consistently by Director Kieft and had not been set aside
entirely by Stuy vesant. Thus Walloons, Waldenses, Hugue-
nots, Swedes, Roman Catholics, German Lutherans, Ana-
baptists, and English Quakers settled alongside the supporters
of the Reformed Faith. An asylum had been furnished the
exiled Puritans of New England, and during Stujnresant's
rule there had been a great influx of sects from many parts
of Europe. This was not due primarily to a liberal policy
on the part of the Company, as we have seen. An excep-
tion to this uniformly tolerant policy toward the sects must
be made in the case of Stuyvesant. Whether from a
zealousness to carry out to the letter the instructions of the
Company or from a lack of appreciation of the equities of
the situation, Stuyvesant attempted to inaugurate a different
policy from that of Kieft in his attitude toward the sects.
Several Lutherans were imprisoned for attending private
meetings. A few humble Baptists at Flushing, on Long
Island, were fined and expeUed. A number of Long Island
Quakers who had been expelled from Boston were treated
in a most barbarous manner by Stuyvesant; and the town
officers of Flushing, who protested against such savage
cruelty, were dfastiaUly punished. But these acts of perse-
cution were certainly isolated cases and were condemned
by public opinion; moreover, they were unanimously con-
demned by the Amsterdam Chamber, and Stuyvesant received
a rebuke. The consciences of men oug^t to be free and
unshackled, so long as they continue moderate, peaceable,
inoffensive, and not hostile to government. Such have been
the maxims of prudence and toleration by which the magis-
trates of this city have been gpverned; and the consequences

have been that the oppressed and persecuted from every
countiy have found among us an asylum from distress.
Follow in the same steps and you will be blest." Stuyvesant
did not interfere again with liberty of conscience.

The last nine 3rears of Dutch sovereignty in New Kether-
land were, in fact, a period of growth and prosperity. Yet,
in comparison with the advance made by the English colo-
nies, this growth was not notable. At the Restoration of
Charles II., the population of New England could not have
been less than fifty thousand, while that of Virginia and
Maryland was about thirty-five thousand and fifteen thou-
sand respectively. A number of reasons have been assigned
in preceding pages for this disparity in population between
the colonics of these nationalities. One important obstacle
to the rapid growth of New Nctherland during this period
has not, however, been considered. Beginning with 1655,
New Netherland experienced all the horrors of Indian
uprisings. Terror seizctl the l;uul and most of the farmers
fled to Manhattan. These Indian troubles interfered with
the peaceful prosecution of the vocations of the inhabitants
of the parts visited by the scourge of war. Furthermore,
inasmuch as they rendered a large immigration to the colony
smaller than it might have been under entirely favorable
circumstances, it will not be out of place at this point to
give a brief account of the most important of these outbreaks.

The relations between the Dutch and the savages had
continued generally friendly for ten years after ICieft's treaty
with the latter at Fort Amsterdam in 1645. The blame
of the Indian massacre of 1655 seems to rest entirely on
one Dutchman, Hendrick van Dyck, who had been schout
fiscal of the province. Van Dyck detected an Indian squaw
stealing peaches from his orchard, and shot and killed her.
Her tribe's people burned to avenge her death, and in this
they were supported by the neighboring savages. On Sep-
tember 15th, before the break of dav, about one thousand
nine hundred Aleonquins landed from sixty-four canoes
and thronged the streets of New Amsterdam. They came

from Esopus and Hackensack, Tappan and Stamford, on
the pretence of looking for Mohawks. They at first offered
no violence to anyone and satisfied themselves with break-
ing into several houses. The council, the city magistrates,
and some of the principal inhabitants held a parley with the
chief sachems in Fort Amsterdam. As a result of this
meeting the savages promised to leave Manhattan at sun-
down, but broke their word. Van Dyck was shot through
the heart, and a neighbor who came to his rescue was
tomahawked. Matters were in a critical condition, indeed,
until the soldiers and militia, sallying from ort Amsterdam,
drove the savages from Manhattan. They passed over to
the Jersey shore, laid Hoboken and Pavonia in ashes, and
killed or captured most of the inhabitants. Statcii Island
was next devastated. In three days one hLindred of the
inhabitants had been killed, one hundred and fiftv had been
taken prisoners, and three hundred had lost their homes.
Twenty-eight bouweries and several plantations had been
destroyed, and the damages were computed at two hundred
thousand guilders.

These Indian troubles continued intermittently. Stu3rve-
sant held a conference with the Indians at Esopus, May,
1658, and a peace was agreed upon. The troubles were re^
newedf however, in the fall. Again the white men were to
blame. Some tipsy Indians who were making nig^t hideous
at Esopus were fired upon by some frightened settlers, and
two or three of the Indians were wounded. This foolish
act led to a war in which several Dutch settlers were burned
at the stake. It became necessary to call in the assistance
of the Mohawks, and it was not until July, 1660, that peace
was made. But hostilities soon broke out afresh. Stuyve-
sant shipped some of the Indian prisoners to Cura^oa. This
* gave a new cause for war. It was not lonp; in coming. In
June, 1663, two villages near Esopus were burned, and the
inhabitants — men, women, and children^ — massacred. The
war that followed lastid nearly a year, and in the end
the Indians were thoroughly defeated. In May, 1664, the

last treaty of peace was entered into between the Dutch and

the Algonquins.

These Indian wars, covering as they did nearly ten years
of Stuyvesant*s administration, somewhat retarded the rapid
growth of the province. Nevertheless, New Netherhnd
experienced unexampU d prosperity, and the bad effect of the
wars was negative ratlier than positive. The war that Kieft
provoked in 1643 had imperilled the existence of the prov-
ince, but these later wars had merely slackened its growth.
Settlers were planting homes north and west of Fort Orange.
In 1 661, Arendt van Corlear was authorized to buy the
** Great I' lats," where later Schenectady was laid out.

Such was the condition of New Netherland when it fell
into the hands of the English. About a year after the
surrender, Stuyvesant was summoned to Hdlland to render
an account of his conduct to the States GeneraL He met
with a rather cold reception, and was blamed by the West
India Company for consequences for which it was primarily
responsible. A request on Stuyvesant's part for justification
of his conduct met with a prompt and hearty response.
Testimony in his behalf came in such abundance from
the leading men of New York that the ex-director was
in the end triumphantly sustained by the government. After
the Treaty of Breda, in 1 667, finally conceded New York
to the English, Stuyvesant set about obtaining a relaxation
of the English navigation laws in favor of the colony by
allowing it a direct commerce with Holland. After having
secured certain very valuable trade concessions from the
King of England, Stuyvesant returned to New York and
spent the remainder of his days in peaceful retirement on
his farm, the Great Bouwerie. Here, in 1682, at the ripe
age of eighty, he died.

The Duke of York hoped to realize ;^30,ooo a year
from the conquered province. To bring about a mate-
rialization of this hope it was necessary to secure a person
of undoubted ability as governor. The duke found in
Colonel Richard Nicolls the qualities necessary to fill the

requirements. He was sincere, courageous, sensible, prudent,
and Hbeiml-mmdedi moreover, he possened great MSXf and
was tomewbat of a tcholar, b^ing fond of die classics and
speaking Dutch and French with fluency* Wherever he
went, hu popdari^ was instantaneous, and New York was
not an exception. He disturbed no one in property or
person. After a year had passed, th^ local government of
buigomasters, schepens, and schout was replaced by a mayor,
aldermen, and sheriff.

NicoUs was the personal representative of the Duke of
York and had authority to make all laws and to carry on
the government. He immediately appointed English coun-
cillors and an English secretary. Once in a while, one or
two of the former Dutch councillors were summoned for
advice. An English garrison was stationed at Albany. The
religious situation w^s. changed hut httlc. Services after
the order of the Church ot England were now established
in addition to those previously held.

In March of 1665 the governor promul^^ated on his own
and the duke's authority a code of laws known as "The
Duke's Laws." It was a body of laws for the government
of the new province, and none could complain of it as
wanting in liberality. It was alphabetically arranged, col-
lated, aiid digested out of the several laws then in force in
the English colonies. It exhibited many traces of Con-
necticut and Massachusetts legM&amp;tion. Governor NicoUs
unag^ied it ^ could not hut be satislactoiy even to the most
6cttous republicans/' Immigrants came into New York
from the neighboring colonies of New England^ on the
strength of tlw promulgation of these laws. All civil and
criminal cases were to be tried where the cause of action
arosis. Cases involving less than £$ were to be arbitrated^
voluntarily if possible, but forcibly if necessary. When the
amount im olved was between and £20^ the case was
to be tried before the ^&lt; Sessions," from which there was no

inquired as to whether a will had been left. No letters of
administration were to be granted until the third session
after the death of the person, except to his widow or child.
Of the surplus of the personal estate, one-third was to go
to the widow and the other two-thirds to the children — the
eldest son retaining a double portion. &lt;«No Christian" was
to keep a skve, except persons adjudged thereto by author-
ity, or such as have willing^j'* sold themselves. No person
was to brew beer except those who were skilled in the
art. The death penalty was to be exacted in the cases of
those who denied the ^^true God or His attributes;" and
of those who committed any wilful or premeditated murder.
Other capital offences were highway robbery, poisoning,
bestiality, kidnapping, false testimony resulting in death,
treason, and conspiracy against the public peace. Children
above the afrr of sixteen who should strike their parents were
to be executed unless they had done so in self-defence.

A church was to be built in every parish. Tlure was
to be no travelling on Sunday, and misdemeanors such as
** swearing, profaneness. Sabbath breaking, drunkenness,**
etc., were to be reported by the churchwardens twice a year.
None but skilled persons were to be permitted to practise
medicine. Pcrjuiy was to be punished by standing in the pil-
lory and by the offender's rendering double damage to the in-
jured person. Apprentices and servants who ran away from
their masters were to serve double the time of their absence.
Innkeepers were compelled to secure certificates of good
character from the constable and two overseers of the parish,
and they were not to ^sul&amp;r any one to drink excessively
in their houses after nine o'clock at night, under a penalty
of %s, In general, the Code confirmed the patroons

in their estates, which were now called " manors." Trial
by jury was introduced and the criminal code was amended.
Religious liberty was guaranteed to all Christians.

To give the appearance of popular sanction to this Code,
Governor Nicolls observed the formality of summoning a
meeting of two delegates from each town, to be chosen by

a majority of the taxpayers. The convention met at Hemp-
stead on the 28th of Febniaiy, 1665. It consisted of
thirty-four delegates— two from each of the English and
Dutch towns on Long Ishnd and two from Westchester.
No deputies were summoned from New York, E^pus,
Bergen, or any other town in the province, for reasons that
later will be made clear. The following places sent two
delegates each: New Utrecht, Gravesend, Flatlands, Flat-
bush, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Newtown, Flushing, Jamaica,
Hempstead, Oyster Bay, Huntingdon, Brookhaven, South-
old, Southampton, Easfhampton, and Westchester.

1 he governor opened the meeting by reading the duke's
patent and his own commission. The delegates objected
to some of the clauses of the Code, and Nicolls accepted
several amendnunts. But when they asked for the privi-
lege of choosing their own magistrates, the governor exhib-
ited his instructions "wherein the choice of all the officers
of justice was solely to be made by the gov ernor." He
then informed the delegates that if they desired a larger
share in the government than he could allow, they ^must
go to the king for it.*' The delegates thus found that they
were not a popular representative body having the power to
make hiws, but were only agents to accept those already
prepared for them. The Oxie was ^promulgated" the
next day, March i, 1665.

This Code, with the alterations and additions made to it
from time to time by the governor and council, continued
to be the law of the colony until 16S3. In that year the
first colonial legislature met, and for a short time the people
were given a share in the legislative powers. The Code
did not by any means provide a constitutional government
for the people of New York. The will of the duke*s
governor was almost supreme in the colony. Fortunately,
Nicolls was liberal and well endowed with admirable char-
actt^ristirs. The Code was intended ultimately to apply
to the whole province and, in fact, several of its provisions
went into general operation at once. Long Island, however.

seems to have been the main object of its application. The
majority of the inhabitants of the Hudson vaUcy were Dutch
and hanlly understood the English language. Consequently,
only by degrees could their institutions be altered with jus-
tice. Nicolls thought it prudent not to enforce the Code in-
New York, £sopus, Albany, and Schenectady.

In the meantime, hostilities were precipitated between
England and Holland. In November, 1664, Dutch gov-
ernment had denounced the conquest of New Netherland as
" an erroneous proceeding, opposed to all right and reason,
contrary to mutual corrcspontfence and good neighborhood,
and a notorious infrnrtion of the treaty lately concluded." It
furthermore demarukd "prompt restitution and reparation.'*
This Charles refused to make. He claimed that New
Netherland had been settled and occupied by the English
prior to the I&gt;utch. Furthermore, that the former had
merely permitted the Dutch nation at the outset to settle
there and that such permission had not conferred upon the
Dutch a just title to the lands thus appropriated. With-
out stopping to argue the question or to demonstrate the
absurdity of this chim, the Dutch reply was that New
Netherland ^must be restored." Secret orders were sent
to De Ruyter, who was in command of the Dutch squadron
on the coast of Africa, to capture the English possessions
there. Likewise, to make reprisals upon the English at
Barbadoes, New Netherland, Newfoundland, and, in fact,
wherever found. The king and the Duke of York were
evidently both disposed to hostilities. Letters of reprisal
were issued against the United Provinces, and, without any
declaration of war, one hundred and thirty Dutch merchant
vessels were seized in the English ports.

Intelligence of this condition of aiBiirs reached Nicolls
by way of Boston. He began to make preparations for
defence. AH the estates of the West India Company were
sequestered and, after the declaration of war, were confis-
cated together with the property of the Dutch who had not

between Holland and Eng^d in March, 16659 and the aid
of France was atked in confomutj with the treaty of 1662.
The citizens of New York were now called together to
devise plans for defence. The governor oSknA to con-
tribute palisades and weapons and, moreover, promised not
to compel any inhabitant to fight against his own nation.
No enthusiasm was elicited. The Dutch seemed not un-
willing that the colony should again pass into the hands of
their countrymen. They did not, however, oppose Nicolls
openly or express their wish for Dutch success. No cate&gt;
gorical answer was given. Some of the people said the de-
fences of the town were sufficient ; others, that they could
not work before they had their arms restored to them.
The town was indeed m no condition to resist De Ruyter's
s^jiiiiilron, should it appear before New York. Nicolls him-
self frankly acknowledged this in a letter to Lord Arlington,
dated July 31, 1665.

Earlv in 1666, the condition of aflfairs became much more
complicated. Louis XIV. of France, who had ck t iared the
Dutch claim to New Nethcrland to be valid, now reluc-
tantly declared war aL'ainst England. The part that France
took in the war was, huvvever, rather insignificant. The
Dutch were compelled to rely mostly upon their n:i\y.
During the war, the naval hoiior&gt; fairly evenly c]i\ i(l(.'d.

In one naval engagement the Dutch suticrcd a, L&lt;jni[)lctc
defeat; twenty of their first-rate men-of-war were captured
or sunk, and three of their admirals and four thousand men
were killed. On the other hand, De Ruyter and Cornelius
de Witt appeared upon the £ngMsh coast, sailed up the
Thames, captured Sheemess, and destroyed a great number
of ships of the line. De Ruyter also ravaged the whole sea-
coast from the mouth of the Thames to L*and's End. The
inhabitants on the coast were teirified, and all England felt
a bitter sense of her d^^dation.

Negotiatbns for peace between the hostile nations had
already been begun at Breda. As a result of this last vic-
toiy, these negotiations were now carried on upon terms

much more advantageous to Holland. They were speedily
concluded and th^ Peace of Breda was tigncd on Bar-
thokmiew's Day, 1667. By this peace. New Netheriand
was formally ceded to the £aj^ish in exchange for Surinam
[Dutch Guiana] in South America and the isbnd of Poleron,
one of the Banda group, near the Moluccas. The Dutch,
on the whole, were well pleased with the terms of die peace
and there was considerable rejoicing at The Hague. The
West India Company's shareholders and the regents of the
city of Amsterdam were, of course, somewhat dissatisfied.
The feeling in England was not unanimous. Although the
church bells rang in Loudon, yet there were no bonfires —
"partly," says Pepys, "from the dearness of hnng, but
principally from the little coiiuiit most people have in the
peace/* Official intelligence of the Peace of lircda reached
New York on New Year's, 1668. Nicolls announced the
good news hjr wanants, addressed to each justice, requiring a
general proclamation of the event. For the next seven years
at least. New York was to enjoy free trade with the Nethor-
hmds. A new order of things opened- with the proclama*
tion of peace. Stuyvesant's success at London in g^ing
a certain measure of commercial freedom encouraged the
merchants to engage in new enterprises.

Two important events should be chronicled before bring-
ing the administration of Nicolls to a close. One was the
trial and acquittal of two persons accused of witchcraft, and
the other was the determination of the bouiid;irics of the
colony. Both redound to the credit of the admmistration
of Governor Nicolls.

All the New England penalties against witchcraft had
been omitted from the "Duke's Laws." Consequently,
when Ralph Hall and his wife Mary were presented by the
authorities of Brookhaven, October st, 1665, for practising
■^some detestable and wicked arts, commonly called witclv-
craft and sorcery,'* the court was at first at a loss to know
how to proceed against them. Finally, it was decided that
they should be. indicted for murder by means of witchcraft.

The case was tried before Nicolls's first Court of Assizes.
Twelve jurvmen sat on the cnse. One of these was Jacob
Leisler, aftci \s ;ird so prominent in the- atiairs of tlie colony.
The jury found that there were "some suspitions by the
evidence" of what the woman was charged with, but that
there was nothing "considerable of value to t:ikc away her
iife. " As for the man, there was ''•nothing considerable to
charge him with." Hall was put under bonds for his wife's
good behavior while she femaiiied in the colony and for her
periodica! appearance at court. After three years, however.
Governor NicoUs finally dismissed the case. How notable
a contrast between the liberality and common sense that
characterized the treatment of this case and the bigotry,
supersdtion,and cruelties that characterized the Salem trials!
No one was hanged in New York in 1665, and the accused
received an impartial trial. At Salem in Massachusetts, in
1692, nineteen were hanged, one was pressed to death by
weight of stones, eight were condemned, one hundred and
fifty were in prison, and two hundred more were accused
by the "afflicted." All were prejudged by a packed jury
presided over by hysterical judges and encouraged by bigoted
and fanatical clergymen.

One of the most important events of Nicolli»'s adminis-
tration was the determination of the boundaries of the prov-
ince. We have seen that Rensslaerwyck, Fort Orange,
and Esopus submitted to Colonel Canwright with hardly a
show of resistances but that New Amstel on the Delawace
under its commandant, Alexander Hinnoyossa, ofaed a
determined but ineffectual resistance to Sir Robert Carr.
The Duke of York's patent extended only to the east bank
of the Delaware, and, according to the charter Charles I.
gave Lord Baltimore, the whole western shore was part of
Maryland. The duke, however, paid no attention to this
prior right and practically annexed the whole western shore
of Delaware Bay. In fact, the royal commissioners had
been instructed by the king to reduce to his obedience the
Dutch wherever seated within his claimed dominions in

North America. It was claimed that the Maryland people
were in some way overawed by the city of Amsterdam,
which owned the Delaware settlements, and that unless they
were secured the acquisition of New York, would be of
small advantage to the king. The " Territories ** on the
Delaware cuusequently reniamed a part of New York until
1682, when they were given to William Penn.

The loyal commissioners next turned their attention to a
still more delicate task. The Connecticut charter of 1662
included not only New Haven in its jurisdiction but also a
large part of New Nedierland. By the Duke of York's
charter of 1664^ New York began at Connecticut RiveTy
and included not only Long Island and the New Haven
colony but even Hartford itself. New Haven at first stoutly
refused to be swallowed up by Connecticut, because the
latter*s charter had been surreptitiously obtained "con-
trary to righteousness, amity, and peace." As soon, how-
ever, as it saw that it must submit to New York if it
did not to Connecticut, it readily decided upon the latter
alternative.

The Connecticut authorities nuvv saw they were depend-
ent upon the recommendations that NicoUs might make to
the Duke of York and to the king. Should he insist upon
Connecticut River as the western boundary line of New
York, he would probably be supported in his contentions.
It was clearly good policy for Connecticut to concfliate the
royal commissioners ; so live hundred bushels of com and
some horses were presented to them, and agents were ap*
pointed to go with Governor Winthrop to New York to
discuss the question of boundaries with the commissioners,
NicoUs, Cartwright, and Samuel Maverick. NicoUs was not
inclined to press his claims beyond what was reasonable.
An agreement satisfactorv to all interested parties was hnaiiy
reached. The southern boundary of Connecticut was to be
the Sound, and Long Island was to be a part of New York.
Nicolls himself pleaded the cause of Connecticut with re-
spect tu her western boundary. He held that tu insist upon

Connecticut River as the eastern boundary of New York
would cast dishonor upon his majesty " and would result
iii the utter ruui ot that colony aiui a nianites: breach of
their late patent." Furtheruiure, that in the dehcatc rela-
tions which the conuiussioners sustained to New England, it
would be good pubhc policy to make the settlement of this
boundary dispute a "leading case of equal justice." Con-
sequently, it vsas agreed that the boundary line should run
from the head of Mamaroneck Creek to the north-northwest
until it reached the Massachusetts line, keeping always
"about twenty miles from anv part of Hudson's River.**
The hfst day of December, 1664, the agreement was rati-
fied by the royal cummisbiuncis and signed by Winthrop
and his colleagues.

There is little doubt but that Connecticut secured a dis-
tinct advantage in this boundary agreement. Its commit
tkmers may not have been guilty of the tricJeerf churned by
Bfo«nie«l (History of the SUiti of New Ttrk^ ii, 56), nor
mxf they have been so guileless as suggested by Fiske
{Duidf and ^aktr CMmiit in Jmerica^ ii, 6) \ but certain it
is that the final agreement was Jess advantageous to New
York than had b^n the boundary settlement of 1650 be-
tween the Dutch and the £n^ish colonies. The line
should have started near Stamford and should have run due
north. The line established started about ten miles from
the Hudson, crossed the Hudson near Peekskill, and ended
thirty-five miles west of that river. The error was soon
detected, and the boundary was changed to nearly its present
petition in 1683. The boundary decision was not ratified
by the Duke of York or by the king. Considerable time
elapsed before the affair was finally closed.

To Long Island, NicoUs gave the name Yorkshire, and
divided it into three ridings. Nantucket and Martha's
Vineyard remained a part of New York until 1692, when
they were ceded to Massachusetts. The island of Pema-
quid and a part of the mainland between Kennebec and
St. Croix Kivers were also a part of the duke*s grant.



l62 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



They also were turned over to Massacfiust tts, together
with all the rest ot Maine, after the accession of Wiiliam
and Mary.

After the Peace of Breda, the duke yielded to Nicolls*s
many requests to be relieved of the governorship of the
province. On the 28th of August, 1668, he embarked for
England *^mth every demonstration of respect and regret
from those who, receiving him as a conqueror, bade him
farewell as a friend," He had used his extraordinary powers
prudently and had always acted with the ^integrity of a
true gentleman." Maverick, in writing to Lord Arlington,
said of him, ^by his prudent management of allairs he had
kept persons of different judgments and of diverse natures
in peace and quietness, during a time when a great part of
the world was at war; and furthermore, that no one had
ever arrived at a better understanding with the Indians than
had he." Nicolls took part in the third naval war between
the English and the Dutch and was killed at the battle of
Solebay, May 28, 1672, having reached the forty-seventh
year of his age.

His successor in the government of New York was
Colonel Francis Lovelace. He was a man of respectable
abilities and of worthy character, but much inferior to his
predecessor in both respects. He was by no means enter-
prising, and was content to continue the policy of Nicolls.
This was fortunate. He lacked energy and decision, but
was upright and good-natured and of "generous mind, and
noble.** Lovelace was a court tavonte. His zeal 111 the
interests of Charles IL had resulted in his imprisonment
in the Tower by Richard Cromwell on the charge of high
treason. He had been enrolled as a knight of the KoyiX
Oak" at the Restoration and later had been made a gende*
man of the king*s Privy Chamber. His task as Governor
of New York was to finish as quietly as possible the work
of bringing the Dutch under English authority. To accom-
plish this, he fostered social relations between the settlers of
the two narionalities. He protected the Reformed Church

ill all its privileges and granted the Lutherans and i^res-
byterians religious freedom. In his encouragement of re-
%iou8 toleration he was supported by the Duke of York,
who, by convicdon a Roman Cadiolic, sympathized with -
all who disMiited fipom the Church of Eoghuid,

One of Lovehce'a first popdar acts was the abolition
in 1668 of the classes of **great buighers" and ^small
bufgjlien'' instituted by Stuyvesant in 1657* divisbn
into classes was an imitation of a Dutch custom, but had
proved very unpopular. Members of the council, burgo»
masters, schepens, officers of the militia, ministers of the
Gospel and their descendants, and the descendants of militia
officers, in a male line, were great burg^iers. Others could
be enrolled in this class upon the payment of fifty guilders.
All other persons born in the city were small burghers.
Likewise, all who had been resident there a year and six
weeks; or who had married daughters of burghers; or who
were salaried servants o\' the West India Company; or
who kept a shop or \\ crc cnL:aged in a permanent business in
the city. Transient residents of the city could he enrolled
in this class on the payment of twentv-fivc guilders. The
great burghers were eligible to public offices. In cases of
coiuiction for a capital offence, they were exempt from
coniiscaLiun or attainder. The piu ileges irranted to small
burghers were mostly of a commercial cliaiacter, tending
to add to the facilities for trading. — (0*Callaghan, Hntory
rf New Netherlands ii, 34 1 .)

The new governor, like Stuyvesant and Nicolls, was
soon to experience the restive character of the Engtisfa towns
on Long Ishuid. The government of New Netherland,
unlike those of New Engbnd, was an kutocracy, and had
been continued as such after the English conquest* The
continuance of this form of government had been very dis-
tasteful to the English towns on Long Island, and they
fretted under it. This was especially true of those towns
that had been in alliance with Connecticut. These towns
had reluctantly submitted to the dominance of New York,

preferring to retain their former political connections. At
the conquest, they had been led to expect from the procls-
mation of th€ royal commissioners that they woilM be id-
mittcd to die onfinary privileges and immunitiet of Britiah
subjects. They expected to be g^ven the power of parties
pating in the govemmeiit — of choosing their own representa-
tives to a general assembly with the power of making laws.
Witness £eir chagnn and disappointment, however, when
they discovered that the *^ Duke's Laws ** gianted them none
of those anticipated privileges. They expressed their indig-
nation at what they termed the ^servile submission*' of
their delegates at the Hempstead convention. They con-
sidered some of the laws established by the Code as aibi-
tnuy and oppressive, and some of those made by Lovelace
as Mill more onerous. In November, 1669, petitions from
three towns were presented to Governor Lovelace, asking
for a legislature chosen by the freeholders. NicoUs had
refused a similar request at the Hempstead convention in the
spring of 1665, and Lovelace, likewise, had no authority to
grant it. He merely replied that nothing was required of
them but obedience and submission to the law of the Gov-
ernment, as appeared by His Royal Hig^ess's Commission
which had often been read to them.*'

The trouble reached a climax in 1670. In October of that
year the Court of Assizes ordered a tax levied on the Long
Island towns for the repair of Fort fames. Those towns,
however, having had their petition tor a representative as- .
sembly rejected the year before, were in no mood to submit
to this tax. They clainud it was contrary to the principle
of "taxation by consent," which had been maintained in
Holland since 1477 and asserted in England since 1265.
They hati paid a direct tax of a penny a pound to defray
the expenses of their own town govnwmients and had, in
addition, paid the duke's customs duucb. Subnnssion to
this last tax, however, would form a bad precedent. They
wcic not represented in the Court of Assizes ; and if that
body could levy a tax to rebuild a palisade, it could likewise

levy one to support the garrison and they knew not what
else. Southold, Southampton, and Easthampton agreed to
contribute provided they might have the privilege enjoyed
by the king's tubjects in New England. Huntingdon re&gt;
fiiaed becaiiae it was deprived of the liberties of English-
men. Jamaica held the tax inconsistent with the British
Constitution, but declared its willingness to bear the tax in
patience if it was the king's express purpose to "disprivilege"
it. Flushing and Hempstead concurred with Jamaica.
These remonstrances were adjudged "false, scaiulalous,
illegal, and seditious, teruimg only to disatfect all the peace-
able and well-meaning subjects" of the king in the province.
Lovelace ordered the remonstrances burned publicly before
the town hall in the citv of New York, and at the same
time ordered criminal proceedings to be begun against the
pnncipal seditionaries. It was easier to burn ^.cciitious**
remonstrances than to remove the cause of their being made.
Long Island continued fur some time disaffected and was
more or less a thorn in the side of the duke's administration.
An appeal to the king was made by several of the towns,
and it is worthy of note that when the war between Hol-
land and England reached its height "benevolences" were
asked instead of taxes.

In the meantime political conditions in Europe were so
readjusting themselves as to portend important changes in
New York. The remarkable success of the armies of
Louis XIV. in Flanders led to the formation of the Triple
AlUanoe between England, Holland, and Sweden j^inst
Fiance. As a result, Louis was compelled to suspend his
conquests and make peace with Spain. The Triple Alli-
ance was very popular in Eng^d. Bishop Burnet said it
was certainly the masterpiece of King Charles's life; and
if he had stuck to it, it would have been both the strength
and the glory of his reign. It disposed his people to forgive
all that was post and to renew dieir confidence in him,
which was much shaken hy the whole conduct of the Dutch
war." The movements of the French as a result of the war

caused much excitement in New York. In the summer of
June, 1671, the move made by Courcciles toward New York
caused a panic in the province. Some of the people made
prcpaiations to move away before the French could reach
them. But the cause of the excitement soon changed from
the French to the Dutch. French gold and a French woman,
combined with a hatred for the Dutch and a probable desire
to establish the Roman CatfaoUc fiiith in England^ led
Charles II. to break away from the Triple Alliance. A
secret treaty was concluded at Dover in May, 1670, be-
tween Charles and Louis. A second but open treaty was
likewise negotiated in January, 1671, By the terms of the
latter treaty, the United Provinces were to be dismembered
and all except Holland were to be annexed to England and
France.

War broke out in 1672. The war was to be fought by
England on the sea and by France on land. Accordingly,
the navy of the former captured the Dutch Smyrna fleet
even before war was declared, and an immense army of the
latter very shortly invaded Holland. "No clap of thunder,**
wrote Temple, "could more astonish the world** than the
capture of the Smyrna fleet.

News of the war led Lovelace to make prompt prepara-
tions for the defence of New York. He was directed by
the king to put the whole province in a condition of defence
and be warned against private men-of-war. The warning
was timely. While De Ruyter and Cornelius van Tromp
were defending Holland against the auacks of the English
and French squadrons, a Dutch fleet of fifteen ships under
Cornelius Evertsen was cruising in the West Indies for the
purpose of harassing the English. Joined by a fleet under
Jacob Binckes and enlarged by prizes, the combined forces
resolved to sail for New York. The fleet, consisting of
twenty-three vessels, carrying one thousand six hundred
men in addition to their crews, anchored under Staten
Island, August 7, 1 673. Governor Lovelace was absent in
New England, but his presence would not have changed the

result. On the 9th of August, after shots had tucn ex-
changed between the fleet and Fort James, New \ork was
formally surrendered to the Dutch.

There was once more a gener.il change of names and a
reestablishment of old h&lt;)undar\ lines. "New Netherland"
was restored i Fort James was changed to^Willem Hcn-
drick,'* in honor of the Prince of (Jraiigc, and New York
City was changed to "New Orange"; Kingston [Esopus]
became "Zwaanenburg"} Albany became "Willemstadt,**
and Its block boute, ^FoR Nassau"; New Jersey became
«^Achter Koll/' or «*Back Bay/' A council of war ap-
pointed Antbony Colve, a captain of infantiy. Governor of
New Netberiand. His commiiSion described bis govern-
ment as extending from fifteen miles soutb of Cape Hen-
lopen to tbe east end of Long Island and Shelter Island;
thence tbfoug^ tbe middle of tbe Sound to Greenwicb and
northerly according to tbe boundaiy line established by tbe
tica^ of Hartford in 1650. Tbe western boundary was
OeUwaie Bay and River* Pemaquid, Martha's Vineyard^
and Nantucket were not included. A large part of the ter-
ritoiy submitted to the change peacefully and some towns
even gladly. The eastern Long Iskmd towns, Southamp-
ton, Easthampton, Rrookhaven, Southold, and Huntingdon,
yielded unwillingly. Lovelace learned of tbe surrender
while in New £ngland, and, hastening over to Long Island,
tried to raise its militia for the purpose of retrieving the
calamity. Later, he was enticed over to New York, arrested
for debt, stripped of his property, and then given permission
to leave the province six weeks after he had paid his debts.
However, as there seemed to be no present or remote pros-
pect of his paying his debts and there seemed to be no other
reason for keeping him, he was allowed to embark in the
fleet for Holland.

Colve displayed remarkable energ)' in putting the defences
in shape to resist a possible attack from England or New
England, There seemed to be no immediate danger from
the former source. In New England, on the contrary, there

was every indication of an approaching conflict. A protest
by Southampton against the Dutch conquest met with
a ready sympathy from the New England Confederation.
First, (Connecticut sent troops over to Long Island; then
Ma^^sachiisctts decided to take action after meeting with
losses oil the hiy;h seas at the hands of the Dutch; Plvm-
outh declared there was "just ground for a war," and Rhode
Island put her harbors in a state of defence against attacks
by the Dutch. Had all the New England colonies united
in an attack upon iVlanliattan, Colve's situation would have
been precarious in the extreme. By the spring of 1674,
however, the fort was nearly completed, and mouiited one
hundred and ninety guns. To make the fort effective, Colve
found it necessary to pull down a large number of buildings
that had been built too close to its walls. Those who suf^
fercd by this wholesale dcstrucLion and removal were assigned
new lots and recompensed out of a tax levied for the pur-
pose. To pay the expenses of these repairs extraordinary
duties were levied and a large amount of £jiglish and French
property found in the city was confiscated.

Colve then tinned hia attention to the eattem end of
Long Uand. An expedition was sent to Shelter Island with
the intention of reducing to subjection the towns that were
proving refmctoiy. Fits John Winthrop with the Con-
necticut forces had reached Southold. Forces were likewise
hurried from Southampton and Easthampton, and it was d^
cided to make a stand against Colve's men at Southold.
The Dutch forces appeared before the town and demanded
its surrender. In case of refusal, the town was threatened
*^with fire and sword." The answer was returned that
the Dutch commander would be received ^'as a person
that disturbs bis majestjr's subjects." Thereupon shots
were exchanged without any damage being done. The
Dutch, finding the £nglish too strong for them, returned to
Manhattan.

While these events were occurring in New Netherland,
the war between Holland and £n^and was rapidly drawing

to a close. The attack upon Southold had occurred on
March 6, 1674* The Treaty of Westinmster, by which the
war was brought to a close, had been signed on February 19,
1674. In Holland, just prior to the treaty, the States Gen-
eral had decided to grant the request of the burgomasters
and schepens of New Orange to assume the government
of the province of New Netherland. Joris Andrine^, sec-
rctarv to the provincial fleet, was appointed governor to
succeed Colvc. The 1 rcatv of Westminster, however,
changed all ihcse plans. Four days after the appoint-
ment of Andnnga as Governor of New Netherland, the
States General had offered to restf^re the province to Eng-
land. This offer was not a voluntary one, but was dictated
by necessity. The success of France in the war threatened
the interests of the Hcuisc of Hapsburg in Spain and Austria.
Holland, const ijuently, found herself in the odd [position of
being op ji used by her former friends and suppuricd by her
former enemies. Spain succeeded in persuading Holland to
make peace with England. Charles was willing to come
to terms on condition that conquests should be mutually
restored as they were prior to the war. Furthermore, that
Holland should pay England a liberal war indemnity. The
tKaty was signed on February 19, 1674, and proclaimed at
the City Hall of New Orange on the 1 1 th of July following* •

The Duke of Yorkfs proprietorship over New York was
decided hy the crown lawyers to have been extinguished by
the Dutch conquest. The sovereign Dutch States General
had created directly with Charies IJ. as sovereign, and as
such the latter was sole proprietor of the ceded province.
Consequently, a new patent was issued to the Duke of
York. New Jersey, all territoiy west of Connecticut River,
Long Island and adjacent ishnds, and Pemaquid were in*
eluded in thia entirely new grant. NicoUs's arrangements
with Winthrop and the rights of Berkeley and Carteret were
completely ignored.

At the time of the transference of New York to the
English, the province contained scarcely twelve thousand

uhitc persons. Schcncctndv was the rciiiocest sctticmcnt
on the Mohawk. The population was quite cosmopolitan
— the namc^ indicating immigrants from Prussia, Germany,
Switzerland, Bohemia, Norway, and Denmark. In an en-
graving in the Dcsn-if'tiwi of New Netherlands by Amoldus
iVIontanus, 1671, \\ l ha\ (.- \«.'hat purports tu be a picture of
New York as it was at that time. Inncss calls it a "non-
descript sketch of little worth." There is an account of the
city, likewise, in Daniel Denton's Brief Description of New
Tork^ London^ 1670. The houses wm sharp-gahled stnic-
Cities of one and two stories. The foit and the church
were not hx from the bay. Demon describes the city as
^biiik most of brick and stone and coveted with led and
bbck tile; and the knd being hi|^» it g;ives at a distance a
pleasing aspect CO the spectator.'* The Idn^s cosmographer,
John G^by, gives a more ehdwiate picciue of the city, but
he seems to have compiled it chieiy from Denton and
Montanus rather than from observation. The climate
necessitited thick clothing in winter, and the account by
Knickerbocker of the manifoid petticoats and troasers is
not far from correct. The tavern was a promineat feature
of the town life. A fair cralled the Kirmess brought the
population together for a succession of holidays. The most
important act of Lovelace's administration was the estab-
lishment of a regular monfhlv post service between New
York and Boston. The order was issued on December 10,
1672, and was the first reeular mail service in America. In
a letter to Winthrup, dated December 27th, Lovelace wrote
that the first change of horses would be at Hartford. AI!
letters ijutvvard were to be " pos^tpaitl," and those coming to
New York were to be post prepaid likewise. The marl was
to start on the tirst Monday of each month and return the
same month. The regulations established by Lovelace were
quite simple and hiteresting. The lurst post was to have
started on Kew Year's IHy, 1673, ^^P^
until the Albany news reached New York. It was not until
January 22d that the start was finally made. The route

led through Harlem, Pelham Manor, Greenwich, Stamford,
New Haven, Hartford, and Springfield. The postman
crossed bodies of water in boats, followed Indian trails,
bridle paths, and watercourses. Wagon roads were the ex-
ception. Letters were placed in scaled bags, according to
their destination. Only "by-letters" were placed in an
open bap;. The interests of this postal service had called/
Lovelace to New England when New York w as recaptured
by the Dutch. The first Merchants' Kxchange was also
established during Lovelace's administration. It met Friday
mornings, near the site where now Broad Street is crossed
by Exchange Place. Lovelace encouraged shipbuilding, and
in partnerdiip with some others he buik two ships — one
being very stronge and handsome vessel but costly'*
named the Good Famt.

Lovelace having fallen out of favor, it was necessary for
the duke to appoint a new governor of New York. His
choice fell upon Major Edmund Andros, an officer in Prince.
Rupert's regiment of dragoons, a member of the royal
household, and commander of the king's forces in Barbadc &gt;cs.
He had fought with distinction in the wars in Holland. The
Duke of York accordingly commissioned him Lieutenant
and Governor,'* July i , 1 6 74. His commission was simihur to
those of NicoUs and Lovelace. Andros was born in London
in 1637, and was of an excellent family. He was a moderate
Episcopalian, unblemished in his private chanictcriind fairly
well educated. He spoke Dutch and French fluently and
had undoubted administrative ability. He lacked tact and
sympathy, and in enforcing the unjust mandates of his
unscrupulous superiors he earned the reputation of being a
conscienceless tyrant.

Andros arrived in New York on the lid of October, and
on the icth of November he assumed the government
and appointed officers. The transfer caused less friction
than might have been expected. By his instructions, Andros
was required to administer justice to the Dutch and English
with all ^possible equality to observe the laws of NicoUs

and T.ovclace; and to permit all persons to worship as they
saw ht. In sonic- matters, hov\ever, Andros showed that
crude want of tact that characterized him throughout his
official career. Manning, who surrendered the province to
the Dutch fleet, was degraded and declared incapable of filling
any office of trust. John Burroughs, town clerk of New-
town, was publicly disgraced for representing the grievances
under which his fellow townsmen suffered. When Corne-
lius Stcciiwyck, Johannes van lirugh, Johannes dc Ptyster,
Nicholas Bayard, Aegidius Luyck, William Beekman, Jacob
Kip, and Anthony de Milt, representing many prominent
burghers of New York, objected to taking the oath of
allegiance without the modification permitted by Nicolls^
Andros clapped them all into prison. They were chaiged
with mutinous and inflammatory behavior, but were released
on bonds. Later, they were tried on the less serious chaige
of having en^iged in trade without having taken the oath of
allegiance. Seven were convicted, but on their yielding all
penalties were remitted. Then a^in, in 1678, Jacob Mil-
borne was arrested as "a mutinous person" and fined £^S»
On the other hand, there is no doubting Andros's in-
domitable courage and loyalty to the interests of his supe-
riors. When the Long Island towns, Southold, Easthampton,
and Southampton, claimed to be under the jurisdiction of
Connecticut, Andros compelled them to submit to his
administration without further ado by threatening to deal
with them as if in rebellion. He laid claim to all of
Connecticut west of Connecticut River, and requested the
General Court of that colony to turn the territory over to
him. On the 8th of July, 1675, he reenforced his claim
upon the territory in question by appearing before Saybrook
with three sloops-of-war. The Connecticut authorities,
however, were prepared for his arrival. Captain Bull was
in charge of the fort. All the major could do was to have
read aloud the duke^s patent, to which was read in reply the
Connecticut General Court's manifesto in which Andros
was referred to as a disturber of the peace. Andros was thus

compclkd to withdraw most ignuiiiiiiiuubly, although the
garrison rcspcctL-d his feelings sufficiently to salute him
upon his fkparture. On his return, he landed at Southold
aiid trum there despatched soldiers to look after his interests
in the islands of Nantucket auU .Martha's Vineyard.

The Indians, in the meantime, were bcgiimlng to give
trouble. King Philip's war broke out in the summer of
1675. Andres's visit to Saybrook was in part the result
of this Indian outbreik. His attention was, however, soon
turned to an Indian questimi of far greater moment than
King Phi]ip*8 war. The Iroquois had never forgotten the
attack made upon them at Ticonderoga hj the French under
Champlain. They took every opportunity of striking a blow
at the French in Canada. We have already seen how the
htter, in i666» under CourceUes, then governor, attempted
to chastise the Iroquois league, Coun^Ues penetrated the
Mohawk country as fiur as Schenectady, and at another tune
destroyed the rsther extensive fortifications of the Iroquois.
All these aggressive attempts of the French to rid themselves
of the fury of the league failed. The French authorities
then turned their efforts toward gaining the friendship of
the Indians. Through the Jesuit missionaries, they made
some headway in winning over the Oneidas, Onondagas,
Cayugas, and Senecas. The Mohawks were beyond re-
demption.

Andros soon saw the seriousness of the situation. The
Duke of York seems to have favored the efforts of the
Jesuits \ but Andros saw that an alliance between the French
and the Long House would mean the paramount supremacy
of France in American affairs. He decided to visit the
Indian country. After making brief stops at Esopus and
Albany, the governor penetrated the wilderness sixteen
miles to Schenectady — then a little Dutch village marking
the remotest western outpost of civilization." From here
he journeyed to the three principal "castles" of the Mo-
hawks. The first was situated on the west bank of Scho-
liarie Creek at its junction with the Mohawk ^ the second^



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



at Ouiajoharie ; and the third, on the site occupied bjr the
town of Danube in Herkimer County. Leaving the Mo&gt;
hawk countiy, the party penetrated the Oneida countiy as .
fiur as a stronghold known as Nundadasis, contigyous to
the site of the city of Utica. Here was heM a cong^vss of
the principal chiefs of the Iroquois league. Presents were
exchanged) the pipe of peace was smoked, and the Long
House swore eternal friendship for the English and enmity
for the French. I he ancient Dutch treaties were renewed
and Andros was formally given the title ^^Corlear," which
he had first received nt the third Mohawk castle. Arendt
van Corlear, the founder of Schenectady, had signified to
the Indians Dutch power and Dutch friendship. The most
important result of this conference was the organization, in
August, 1675, of a local board of Coniniissioncrs for Indian
Atfaifs. This had its headqtiarrers at Albany. Robert
Livingston, the town clerk of Albany, was made secretary
of this board.

Sir George Carteret had claimed that when the king re-
granted him East Jersey alter the Treaty of Westminster,
he was continued as lord proprietor, i he Duke oi York,
on the other hand, clairnqd that Carteret was but a lord of
the manor, and as such under the sovereignty of New
York. Philip Carteret, representing the widow of Shr Geoige
Carteret, acted upon the former assumption, called an as-
sembly, and declared Eltsabethtown a free poR. Andros
was instructed by the duke to seize vessels clearing from
any other port than New York. Philip Outeret denied
Andnis's right to assert, in any ittpect whatever, soveragmy
over Jersey soil and in this he was supported by his assem-
bly. Tlus resulted in Andios's first deposing Carteret, and
then in causing his arrest, which was accomplished in a
most brutal manner. After a four weeks* imprisonment he
was brouf^t to trial before a jury and acqu&amp;ted, much to
the chagrin and open anger of his persecutor. At first Car-
teret was not permitted to assume any authority in East
Jersey, either civil or military. Later, however, he was

escorted back bv Andros liimself and partly reestablished in
his rights. Lady CarLerct, upon hearing of these violent
proceedings against her representative and against her rights,
had the matter brought to the attention of the Duke of
York, The duke, fearing the Carteret power at court,
mendaciously denied responsibility for the action taken by
Andros. Following up this statement, he furthermore for-
mally relinquished ms claim upon East Jersey and confirmed
it in the proprietorship of Sir George Carteret's heir.

Many other complaints of Andros's conduct likewise
reached England in 1680. In addition to his tactless man-
agement of the East Jersey afikir, it was urged that he
unduly favored Dutch shipping, and permitted the people
of Boston to traffic in furs with the Mohawks. In conse-
quence, he was summoned by the duke to justify bis
conduct. He sailed in January, i68i, leaving Lieutenant-
governor Anthony Brockholls in charge of affairs. The
duke sent over John Lewin to investigate the conduct of
Andros in his administration of the affairs of the province.
His report was entirely favorable. Andros was vindicated
and received a substantia! token of his vindication in being
made a gentleman of tlie king's privy chamber. He did
not return until he was sent out as governor-general of all
the northern colonies.

Brockholls at once experienced trouble. For some un-
accountable reason, Ancirus had neglected to renew by a
special ordinance the customs duties imposed in 1677 and
expiring in November, 1680. After the governor's dc-
parture^ the merchants refused to pay any duties on imports.
The lieutenant-governor was not sure he had authority to
renew the duties, and the council advised him that he could
not collect them without specific orders &amp;om the Duke of
York. The whole dispute was precipitated when William
Dyer, collector of the port, was arrested for traitorously
exercising ^ regal power and authority" by demanding the
payment of taxes not legally due. He was brought to trial,
but appealed to the courts in England. There, he was

examined by the king's legal advisers and received a material
vindication of his conduct in being made surveyor-general
of customs in America.

Bfockholls was now persuaded to present to tbe duke a
petition for a legislative assembly. The demand was urgent,
it was held, because the people " were groaning under inex-
pressihie burdens of an arbitrary and absolute power** by
which "revenue had been exacted, their trade crippled, and
their liberties enthralled." Pressure for money led the duke
to {^rant the petition. The condition he made was that the
colony should raise sufficient funds to pay the public debts
and maintain the government suitably.

The calluig of the first assembly was left to the successor
of Andros. On September 30, 1682, the duke commis-
sioned Colonel rhonias Dongan Governor of New York.
He was born in 1634, and was a younger son of an Irish
baronet. He was a Roman Catholic and held a colonelcy
in the royal army. He had fought in France^ had been
lieutenant-governor in Tangier; was energetic and covetous,
yet ^a man of integrity, moderation and genteel manners."
He arrived in New York on August 289 1683, amid universal
rejoicing. He was instructed to summon a General Assem-
bly, to consist of not more than eighteen persons, who were
to be chosen by all the freeholders. The Assembly was to
have free liberty to consult and debate for all laws." The
duke alone could exercise the right of veto over its acts.

After a hurried visit to Albany, the governor issued a
formal summons for the Assembly, bearing the date Sep-
tember 13, 1683. '^^^ Assembly met in Fort James, Octo-
ber 17th. There were eighteen delegates in all: Schenectady
sending one; Albany and Rensselaerwvck, two; Esopus,
two; New York and Harlem, four; Staten Island, one;
each of the three ridings [districts] of Yorkshire [Long
Island], two; Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, one;
Pemaquid, one. The session lasted three weeks, and four-
teen acts were passed. The first and by far the most im-
portant of these acts was "The Charter oi Liberties and

Privileges," It declared that under the king and lord pro-
prietor the supreme legislative authority was to reside in the
governor, Council, and the people represented in a General
Assembly. The Assembly was to meet at least once in three
years, and cverv freeholder was to have the privilege of
electing the representative without any manner of con-
straint c;r imposition.** A majority of votes was to deter-
mine the election. The usual Parliamentary privileges were
conferred upon the members of the assembly, and the m.tst
liberal provisions of English law were declared to extend to
the inhabuants of New York. Freedom of conscience and
religion was guaraiiteed to all peaceable persons who pro-
feb^ed faith in God by Jesus Christ.** No manner of
taxes were to be laid upon any excuse whatever except by
the act of the governor, Council, and Assembly. An ac-
coni[niiu ing act was passed granting the duke and his heirs
certain duties un imports. This charter was proclaimed on
October 31, 1683. "In no other colony in America had
the principle of representation of the people as a condition
of taxation been so clearly asserted by statute at that day."
In fact, March 3, 1685, when the duke liad become king,
he objected to the words ^the people*' as being ^not used
in any other constitution in America."

A second act, passed on the ist of Noyember, divided New
York into twelve counties — ^New York, Westchester, Ulster ,
Dutchess, Orange, Albany, Richmond, Kings, Queens, Su^
folk^wtthin the present limits of the State. In addition
there were Dukes, including Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard
and dependencies, and ComwaU, including Pemaquid and
adjacent territory.

A third act established four distinct tribunals in New
York: town courts, to be held monthly for the trial of small
ofiences; county courts (Courts of Sessions), to be held
quarterly or half-yearly; a general Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner, to sit twice a year in each county and having original
and appellate jurisdiction s and a Court of Chancery, to be
the supreme court and composed of the Council and the

governor or a chancellor to represent him. Any person
could appeal hoai the judgment of this court to the king.
A naturalization law was passed at the i.arnc time.

In December, these acts of the Assembly were sent to
England for the duke's approval, but before he had affixed
his signatuie to them an important event occurred which
brought with it many momentous changes. Early in Feb-
ruaiy, Charles 11. was striclten with apoplexy and died on
the 6th of that month. He was succeeded by his brother the
Duke of York, as James II. This accession boded ill for
popular rights in the colonies. New York became a royal
province, and the attitude of its former proprietor toward it
was changed. James the king was a different man from
James the duke. He held that the "Charter of Privileges"
tended toc^ much to restrain the governor and to abridge the
king's power. Consequently, he did not sign the charter
nor did he repeal it, but held it in abeyance until he should
devise another plan of colonial government. The results of
his attempts to niatcnaii/.c this plan we shall have occasion
to consider in a subsequent chapter.

CHAPTER VIII

MIGRATION OF THE OPPRESSED

Wb have thus hi spoken of the English, Dutch, ami
Swedes because to them belongs the major credit of colo^
nizlng the territory now known as the Middle States. We
must not, however, lose sight of the lesser' divisions of
emigration that became fused into the conglomeiate popu-
lation of the Middle States. In the present chapter we
propose to treat in detail those groups that for one reason
or another cannot properly be classified under the general
headings of English, Dutch, or Swedish. Wr may begin
with the Walloons. These people had passed through the
fire of persecution. They inhabited originally the southern
Bclgic provinces of Hainault, Namur, Luxemburg, Limburg,
and part of the ancient bishopric of Liege, and spoke the
old French language. At the union of the northern prov-
inces of the Netherlands in 1579, the Roman Catholic
' southern provinces declined to be parties to it. Many of
their inhabitants, nevertheless, had accepted the principles
of the Reformation. Against these Protestant Walloons,
the Siianish government directed with unrelenting fury all the
engines of the Inquisition. In consequence, they emigrated
by thousands to Holland, where they knew that the perse^
cuted of every race and creed could find safe asylum. Th^
carried with them a knowledge of those arts in which they
were hi2:Vilv proficient and thus added greatly to Holland's
reputation as a manufacturing nation.

Hearing of the New World and the wide range given to
ambitious and industrious people, these refugees determined
to try their fortunes in America. Accordingly they petitioned
for the privilege of migrating to Virginia. But satisfactory
arrangements could not be made with the Virginia Company,
and tSus their first attempt failed. Shortly after, the Dutch
government learned of their desire to migrate and, knowing
from experience what desirable citizens they made, deter-
mined to send them out under the auspices of the Dutch West
India Company. Accordingly, when in March, 1623, the
New Netherland sailed for the New World, she conveyed a
company of thirty families, most of whom were Walloons.
The superintendence of the expedition was intrusted to the
experienced Cornelius Jacobsen May, of Hocrn. He was to
remain in New Netherland as the first director of the colony.
The second in command was Adrian Joris, of Thienpont.

After a vovage of two months, they arrived safciv at
Manhattan. Here May left a party of eight men, while
other parties were sent to establish colonies on South and
Fresh Rivers. Most of the immigrants, however, settled
on the west bank of Hudson River, at a point where, the
year before, Fort Orange had been begun. Here eighteen
families, under the leadership of Adrian J oris, took up their
homes. They finished the fort and set to work imme-
diately tilling the soil and constructing themselves some
huts of bark." Shortly after, some of the neighboring In-
dians, the Mohicans and some of the Iroquois, visited the
settlement, bringing Joris valuable presents. A covenant
of friendship was entered into between them, which was
sacredly kept for several years. This was the be^nning of
Albany, now the capital of New York. Yet another party
settled on the shore of Long Island at a deep bay near the
present site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The name
MWallabout," or Walloon Bay, is commemorative of the
nationality of some of these early settlers.

In 1660 still another expedition of the oppressed Wal-
loons, who had temporarily sought refuge along the banks

of the Rhine, came to America. Under the leadership of
Louis du Bois, they settled in Esopus and began the towns
of Kingston and New Paltz.

The persecution of the Puritans by the king and the
Established Church of England, instead of extirpating this
sect, had the contrary effect of strengthening their faith and
adding to their numbers. So severely were they persecuted
in the time of James I., that rather than give up their prin-
ciples they decided to exile themselves from their native
coiuitrjr. Th^ had often heard extolled the liberality of
Holland) where, it was said, there was religious toleration
for all. So, early in 1608, a party of about one hundred in
all set out for that country to dwell among strange people.
Their leaders were John Robinson, their minister, and Wil-
liam Brewster, their ruling elder. First they settled at
Amsterdam, where they remained for a few months. The
following year, however, they went to Leyden and were
ioined there by other refugees. By hard work and indomi-
table piuck thev at Icnfrth won a competent and comfortable
living. They remained in Leyden twelve years, h;i\ mg been
treated all the while hy the Dutch with marked kmdness and
generous consideration.

Nevertheless, they continued to fee! that they were aliens
and longed for a spot where they could establish their own
schools and churches. Their treatment by the Hollanders
bad been so ontformly kind, it is not strange that when once
they decided to emigrate to the New World, they sought to
do so under the auspices of their benefactors. Accordingly
in 1 620, their leader, tUb Rev. John Robinson, addressed him-
self to the Amsterdam merchants, promising four hundred
families from Leyden and England to colonize New Neth-
erland* They wished, said Robinson, to plant there the
true and pure Christian religion, to convert the savages of
those cotmtries to the true Icnow^ledge and understanding
of the Cliristian hiith, and, through the grace of the Lord,
and to the glory of the Netherlands government, to colo-
nize and establish a new empire." The only stipulation

they made chat in case of attack bjr another power the
United Pfovinces should protect them.

These overtures were gladly listened toby the Amsterdam
company, for they desir^ to establish a substantial coJcmy
in New Netherland. They foresaw that the large number -
of settlers the Puritans promised, judging from the good
record they had made in the Fatherland, could hardly
prove other than successful. They ofiered the Puritans
attractive inducements to emigrate, promising, in fact, to
transport them free of cost to North River and to furnish
every famrly with cattle. A«? to assuring them protec-
tion against a foreign foe, that, they decided, was bcvond
their jurisdiction. Th&lt;-\' referred the whole matter to Prince
Maurice, who in turn referred it to the States Cieueral. But
the statesmen of the Netherlands were too deeply involved
in large and ambitious designs to pass favorably upon the
petition of the Amsterdam company. They were shaping
the constitution ot die W est Intiia Company, whose powers
and capital were to be so great that the States General
fondly hoped it might be instrumental in dealing its ancient
enemy Spain a death blow. Inasmuch as all matters re-
lating to colonization would come under th^ jurisdiction
of this Company, it was decided that this petition should
be deferred.

Aside from this, a more powerful consideration swayed
the States General. A war with Spain was expected, and
it was desired to keep on friendly terms with England, It
knew that the English denied the Dutch title to North River
and Manhattan. It was clear, therefore, that to -plant an
English colon \ ti disputed territory and guarantee it pro-
tection could only end in a quarrel. England might not
object to Holland's extending a helping hand to English refu-
gees in Holland^ when, however, that hand reached across
the ocean and assumed to protect them in what King James
considered English territory', that might prove another ques-
tion. Therefore, the petition of the Puritans was finnlly
rejected and, instead of their migrating to AnAcrica under the

protection of the Dutch, they went under the ausfnces of
the London Company.

The Puritan movement was, however, to be felt in the
Dutch province, for dissensions in New England drove not
a few of the English colonists to New Netherland, where
they found the freedom which in vain they had sought in
the colonies on Massachusetts Bay. Early in 1642 came the
Rev. Francis Doughty and Richard Smith with a party of
other seekers after freedom of worship. They were followed
shortly by John Throgmorton and thirty-five English fami-
lies, who settled on East River and built homes for them-
selves. In 1642 Anne Hutchinson, not feeling secuic from
the Massachusetts authorities, even in Rhode Island, emi-
mted to New Netherland with all her family. All these
Puritan emigrants to New Netherland were received kindly
by Kieft, the director-general. He granted them lands on
which to settle and establish for themselves homes, and be
accorded them all the privileges which the Dutch inhabitants
enjoyed.

Other refugee Puritans settled in Virginia, where they
lived in peace until 1643, when the Assembly passed an act
expelling all Nonconformists from that colony. Many of
these sought and found refuge in Maryland, wberc frredom
of conscience was granted them. There nothing was de-
manded of them but obedience to the laws, fidelity to the
proprietary, and the usual quitrcnts. These conditions they
gladly accepted. Their largest settlement they called Provi-
dence. For a time they were content in their new home
and dwelt peaceably with their Roman Catholic fellow colo-
nists. Eventually, however, they made sorry returns for
the hospitality which Lord Baltimore had accorded them.
In conjunction with other malcontents tlwy compkined to
the English Parliament **that Maryland was but a nursery
of Jesuits and that the poor Protestants were everywhere
suppressed. " This charge was easily proved utterly baseless.

When Oliver Cromwell declared himself Protector, the
confusion which followed in the colonies gave Baltimore's

enemies the opportunity for which they had been long Icok-
ing. Bennett and Claiborne placed themselves at the head
of a party of men from Virginia and Maryland. They
forced the governor, Stone, to resign, and pat in his place a
Captain William Fuller, who, with a Puritan Council, was
to administer affiiirs. Then followed a r^me of intoler-
ance. An Assembly was called, but no Roman Catholic
was eligible to office or could cast a vote. The Toleration
Act of 1649 was repealed, and another, called ^An Act
Concerning Religion,'* was proclaimed. This act dented
protection to all Roman Catholics in the exercise of their
religion. Later, Brownists, Quakers, Anabaptists, and other
miscellaneous Protestant sects" were included within the
operation of the act. In fact, none but the Puritans could
look for protection from the newly established government.

The Reformation in France from the veiy beginning had
gained steadily, until not only many of the middle classes
but many of the aristocracy and even some of the clergy
supported it. They built schools and churches of their
own, and increased numerically in spite of persecution. The
Huguenots, whose greatest strength lay m the class com-
posed of skilled artisans, scholars, and merchants, were the
most moral, industrious, and intelligent of the French popu-
lation. They had found a friend in Henry IV., who in
1598 proclaimed the Edict of Nantes, which granted them
many privilcires and more especially freedom of conscience.
This edict remained in force until its revocation in 1685,
during the reign of Louis XIV.

The migration of French Protestants had been going on
for several years \ it now became so vast that the industrial
welfare of the nation was threatened. Louis forbade all
Protestants Co leave the country. In spite of this decree, how*
ever, the exodus was veiy little diminished. Protestants fled
in di^ise; and many Catholics, pitying them, helped them
on their way. The neighboring Protestant nations eagerly
opened their arms to their oppressed brethren. Money was
raised to assist them to reach an asylum. Holland exempted

them from taxation for twelve years, and all Protestant
countries ofFered them immediate naturalization.

Many of these Huguenots went first tO Holland and
Englaiul, but hnallv tVnjnd their \va\ across the ocean to the
American colonies of their benefactors. I here they were
received with great kindness and consideration, and eventu-
ally did much to enrich their adopted homes. Many of
them found their wiy to New York, where they joined the
rankt of the army of the oppressed from many countriet.
Settling here upon the knd told them by Jacob Leiskr, thor
began New Rochelle, to named in honor of t^ French
town from which so many of them had come. ^

Two hundred thousand Huguenots« driven mm their
homes by tiouis XIV., could not help impressing their
character to a very marked extent upon the people among
whom they settled. Particularly was this true in America,
where, the habits and institutions being new and plastic, every
nationality represented had more or less to do with mould-
ing American life and thought. The Huguenots brought
to the New World their French arts, which were then un-
known in America. They bronc'ht, likewise, their talents
and their knou'ledp;c of mercaniilc atfairs. The advent of
such a people coulci not fail to he beneficial to the colonics.

George Fox, the foumler of the Society of i riciids, was
born at what is now called Fenny Drayton, T.eircstershire,
Entrland, July, 1624. Without doubt the c h iractcr of his
parents had much mtlucncc upon his dcvekjpmcnt. His
father, Christopher Fox, a weaver, was so renowned among
his neighbors for his uprightness that he was called by them
** righteous Christer." His mother, also, was a woman of
great piety and sweetness of character* In his boyhood he
was employed by a shoemaker, who also dealt in wool, and
for a time George tended the sheep, — ^a fit emblem of his
future service in the Church of Christ," says William Penn.
Although a member of the Church of England, the worldll-
ness of the ministers and members of that church was
early realized by him. He felt that the life had completely

MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



departed from the Church service, and that at that time it was
nothing more than a shell. These things greatly distressed
him. He felt something must be done, but knew not what.
The friends to whom he applied for advice and enlighten-
ment gave him no aid. One advised him to get married,
in order to soothe his mind; another — a priest — told him to
use tobacco and take to the singing of psalms. His friends
giving him no comfort, his trouble increased, but in the
midst of all the darkness he says he heard a voice which
said: "There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to
thy conditions." From that time on, he felt that he was the
man called of God to awaken men from thdr lifeless forms
and dogmas to a sense of the vital importance of an inward,
living, spiritual, religion."

He did not intend to found a new sect, but only wanted
to purge the Church of England of its falsities. He re-
fused to take oaths, quoting the Bible injunction "swear
not at all "; neither would he raise his hat as was the custom,
contending that at the name of God alone should that be
done. Also, he refused to address any man with the plural
pronoun, believing it incompatible with the Biblical idea of
simplicity and truth. Because of these things he gave great
offence to his fellow men, and for preaching them he fre-
quently found himself imprisoned. Upon one occasion,
when arrested, having admonished Justice Bennett, before
whom he was brought, "to tremble at the word of the
Lord," the justice, tradition avers, dubbed Fox and his fol-
lowers "Quakers." Although persecuted for their own
peculiarities, the Quakers frequently had to answer for the
absurdities of other newly risen sects. But persecution did
not disturb themj in fact, "they courted it."

The news of the new sect reached America, where the
movement was watched with alarm. In Massachusetts, it
is said, a day of fast and prayer was held "on account of
the news of the doings in England of a strange people called
Qiiakers." Shortly after this, however, in spite of prayer
and fasting, to Boston's horror, two Quaker women came

to town. - They were immediately imprisoned^ their books
were burned, and as soon as possible they were shipped
back to England. But others eame, notwithstanding, and

all Massachusetts was soon in a fever of excitement. The
Quakers were absolutely antagonistic to the settlers of Mas-
sachusetts, and trouble nnturally followed their advent in that
colony. They were imprisoned and whipped, and finally four
of them, one a woman, were handed on Boston Common.

A partv of (^lakers, expel k d from Bostuu by tlic au-
thonucs, came to New Amsteidaiii iii August, 1657. Here,
contrary to precedents, they were treated very little better
than in Boston. Stuyvesant was then in power. He was
somewhat narrow and bigoted and had given, as we have
had occasion to mention, the West India Company serious
trouble by his intolerance and persecution of all creeds save
his own. He made no exception to the Quakers and, in
foct, his treatment of them was even more severe than
usual. Some were imprisoned, while Robert Hodg^n was
both imprisoned and fined. Having no money, he was sen-
tenced to two years* hard labor at a wheelbarrow. He
refused to carry out his sentence, declarrng himself innocent
of any crime. He was repeatedly whipped with a piece of
tarred rope in the hands of a negro. To this outrage was
added two days and nights on bread and water and still
another whipping. By this time the people were aroused,
and offered to pay his fine if he were released. Hodgson
refused this offer, believing a principle was at stake and
he would rather die." Finally, however, public sentiment
became too strong even for Stuyvesant, and the Quaker
was released.

Some of the Quakers who had sought refuge in Mary-
la nd from the persecutions received in New England and

Virginia gave the authorities of the former colony consider-
able trouble. They refused to bear arms or take oaths and,
not content with confining these views to themselves, they
tried hard to prost'b tc others. In 1658, two of their num-
ber, Josiah Cole and Thomas Thruston, were arrested for

refusing to take the oath of fidelity. Later, on "account
of their insolent behavior, in standing presumptuously cov-
ered," they were forever banished. Also, an t^rder was
passed that all Quaker " vagabonds and idlers " should leave
Maryland, and if they ventured to return sh ould be whipped
from constable to constable out of the pr()\ ince. Those
who had entertained Cole and 1 hr ujjtun, together with a
man who had refused to assist in the anrett of the latter,
whi|»ped. This order, howev«r, was in force only
during FendaU's nde. There is no record of Quakers
having been whipped later. Although they were fined for
refusing to bear arms or to contribute funds toward the
militia, they were treated for the most part leniently and
found comparative comfort in the Maryland colony. They
increased so rapidly that in 1661 they had stated times for
meetings, and in 1672 were visited by their founder, George
Fox, who attended several of their meetings.

It is probable that the first settlement of Friends in New
Jersey was made along the banks of Raritan River in 1663.
In 1670, a meeting house was built at Shrewsbury. The
proprietorship of New Jersey had been held jointly by
Lord John Berkeley of Stratton and Sir George Carteret,
but in 1673 the latter sold out his interest in the colony
to a Quaker, John Fenwick, in trust for another Quaker,
Edward Byllinge. Trouble arose between the two Friends
on account of the transaction, which was finally referred to
William Penn for settlement. To Fenwick, Penn granted
one-tenth of the land and a sum of money, and he was to
hand over to Byllinge the remaining nine-tenths of the pur-
chase. After considerable hesitancy, Fenwick finally yielded
to Penn*s decision and surrendered to Byllinge his nine-
tenths. He himself, in company with some other emigrants,
sailed to Delaware River, and on its eastern shore founded
the town of Salem, June, 1675. For this he was subse-
quently put in Fort James, by Andros, for poaching on the
Duke of York's territory. Edward Byllinge had now be-
come iinanciaily embarrassed, and surrendered his share in

the land to WiJliam Penn and two other Quakers, Gawaine

Laurie and Nicholas Lucas. These trustees detennineJ to
establish a refuge in their part of New jersey for all religious
sects, particularly Quakers. In thtir sratcnicnt it is set forth
that no person should '-'-bv called in question or molested
for his conscience or for worshipping according to his con-
science,"

To this asylum in 1677 sailed a ship from England laden
with two hundred and thirty ricjids. Sailing up Delaware
River, they lancicd and founded a village which they culled
Burlington, after the town in Yorkshire whence a large
nuinl&gt;er of them came. They made a treaty with the In-
dians, and won, by their kindness, the friendship of the red
men. The colony grew in numbers and prospered. The
progress of the Quaker colony in West Jersey was watched
with interest by one of the founders — ^William Penn. It
had long been his dream to found an asylum in the New
World where both religious and civil liberty could be enjoyed
by the people. It was to be a place where Quakers and the
persecuted of all sects could find peace and the liberty of
worshipping God according to their own consciences. The
evident prosperity of the colony in West Jersey encouraged
him to believe that the same experiment could be made
successful if carried out on a lafger scale. The financial
condition of England at this time gave him the opportunity
he craved. The government owed the estate of his father
a large sum of money, 6,000, but owing to the poverty
of the nation there was nothing with which to pay the debt.
Penn, therefore, requested the king, in lieu of the money, to
grant him a tract of land in America. There were some
who objected to this plan. They prophesied trouble to the
crown should it be carried out. Nevertheless, in spite of
objections, on Ma.ch 4, 1681, a chatter was granted Penn
recognizing him as the sole proprietor of the territory
called Pennsylvania. He wrote his frame of government and
formed his code of laws. In one of these, his determina-
tion to make Pennsylvania a haven for the oppressed found

expression. It stated " that all persons living in this province,'
who confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal
God to be the Creator, Upholder and Ruler of the world,
and that hold themselves obliged in conscience to live
peaceably aiid justly in civil society, shall in no wise be
molested or prejudiced f m their religious persuasioji or
practice in matters ut taith and worship, nor shall they be
compelled at any time to frequent or maintain any religious
worship, place, or ministry whatever**' In addttton to the
territory granted him, Penn purchased of the Dulce of York
that country later known as the Lower Counties." Penn
now saw the realization of his dream, liis *^ Holy Experiment "
had hegun.

The fiime of this land along the Delaware, where all
religions could live peaceably, spread among the countries
of Europe, and many persons prepared to go to Pennsyl-
vania. In the course of the first year more than twenty
ships sailed for Delaware River, carrying perhaps three
thousand passengers. In 1682, Penn also sailed for his
new colony and reached Pennsylvania in October, landing at
New Castle. The freedom of conscience which the laws
of Pennsylvania offered to all sects alike not only brought
a great number of Quakers to its shores, but likewise the
oppressed of many other sects.

Among them were the Mennonites, or Anabaptists, who
in their belief were very similar to the Quakers. Like them,
they refused to bear arms or take oaths* In 1662, peculiar
articles of agreement had been signed between the buigo-
^ masters of Amsterdam and a society of Mennonitcs. A

I grant of land at Homkill on South River was made to this

sect. A company was formed, and one hundred and seven-
. teen articles of association were agreed upon for the settle-
1 ment. During the first five years after their arrival, they

were to live in common. At the end of that time, the
property was to be divided and each head of a family was
to receive his proportional share. Worthless persons were to
be expelled by a vote of two-thirds of the members. I'he

colonists were plundered of all their effects by the English
in 1664, after the conquest. T he marauding party took
what belonged to the Quaking Society of Plockhov, to a
very naile." After William Pcnn's "Holy Experiment"
was fairly under way, other Mennonitc^,, persecuted alike
by Protestants and Catholics, left their bonus 111 ( Jermany
and Switzerland and settled in Pennsylvania al()jig;side of
the Quakers, to whom they were so near akiii ui reli^nous
belief. The first permanent society in North America was
organized at Germantown, Pennsylvania, in 1683, and these
were followed by many othen from various portions of Ger-
many. Their ]«Euler was Francis Daniel Pastorius. He was
an enthusiastic schokr,** studying science, philosophy, juris-
prudence, or whatever came to hand, and reading eight or
ten languages." In 1712, they purchased some land in
Liancaster Cbunty.

At the beginning of the history of New Amsterdam, we
find that oppressed and persecuted sects of every kind found
there an asylum where they worshipped God according to
their own consciences. After a time, however, the influx
gradually became so great that Stuyvesant, a rabid Calvinist,
began to fear for the supremacy of the established Dutch
Reformed Church. Among the sects which had found a
refuge in New Amsterdam was the Eutheran. By 1656
it had increased to such numbers that, instead of being
content with continuing the former custom of worshipping
in private homes, its members desired a church of their
own. They accordingly petitioned Stuyvesant to permit
them to build a church and to send for a pastor of their de-
nomination. This request the director refused. They then
addressed themselves tu the West India Company, where
again they met with a refusal.

Later, Megapolensis and Drisius, the Dutch ministers,
made complaint that instead of coming to hear them preach
the Lutherans preferred to hold conventicles in their own
homes. Stuyvesant, thereupon, issued a proclamation pro-
hibiting all unlicensed persons from preaching or holding



MIDDLE STATES AND MAKTLAND



conventides not in hamiony with the established religion at
set forth by the Synod of Dort/' Anvone viobting this
ordinance was to be fined one hundred pounds, Flemish,
and a&amp; who attended such meetings would be fined twenty*
five pounds. Immediately, there followed fines and im&gt;
prisonment for the Lutherans. They thereupon complained
to the authorities in Holland, and the zealous StuyvesanC
received a prompt rebuke from the West India Company.
In spite of this, when Ernestus Goetwater came to New
Amsterdam m 1657 with a commission from the Lutheran
Consistory at Amsterdam to preach and organize a church
for the Lutherans, he was arrested and ordered back to Hol-
land. In 1659, the West India Company, again hearing
complaints about the harshness of Dutch clergymen in their
treatment of Lutheran pastors, wrote to Megapolensis and
Drisius that, unless they ceased a *«too overbearing precise^
ness," the directors would permit the Lutherans to build a
church of their own. When the Dutch came under the
masteiy of the English, during Francis Lovekce's adminis-
tration, the Lutherans were encouraged to bring over their
own minister from Holland and were permitted to worship
after their own fashion without being persecuted.

Many of the Lutherans came to Pennsylvania and settled.
Swedish Lutherans came in 1636 and 1637 and joined
the Swedish settlement on the Delaware. Reorus Torkillus
was their first pastor. He was succeeded by Campanius,
who did missionary work among the Indians and translated
Luther's Catechism into the Delaware dialect. The first Lu-
theran church in Pennsylvania was built in 1646. In 17^53,
three of the Pennsylvania congregations sent to Germany
for pastors. In 1742, Henry Melchior Muhlenberg was
sent to them. Muhlenberg was bom in 1 7 1 1 , in Hanover,
Germany. He has been called *^ the patriarch of the Lu-
theran Church in America." Before Muhlenberg came to
Pennsylvania, the German Lutherans, now numerous in the
province, had graduaUy become very indifferent to religious
afEurs. Many were so utterly indifeent, in fiict, thai

it became proverbial to speak of their belonging to the
Pennsylvania Church/'

Many emigrants came to the province without their own
ministers, and having no one to teach them they grew de»
cidedly lax in their religious observances. Many ftUse
teachers arose among them in the years immediately pre-
ceding Muhlenberp:'s arrival. He found the Church needed
a thorough reorgam/ation. Drunkenness was very common.
He writes of Pennsylvania in 1754: "It teems with a
wicked, frivolous rabble and vagabonds of preachers and
students, and the Devil is raging and carr)'ing on his slanders
and calamities against the poor Hallenses." Muhlenberg
set to work, and during his long ministry did much by his
ftithlulness and kindness to bring about a better organization
and a better religious feeling among the -Lttthenuis.

As early as 1603 the Jews were permitted to settle m
Holland, where they prospered and made money, adding
much to the wealth of their adopted country. When the
Dutch West India Company was formed, we find that many
of the Jewish citizens subscribed to the Company's stock
and several of them were made directors. A large number
of them went first to Brazil, when the Dutch took posses-
sion of that country. Later, however, when the Dutch were
driven out by an uprising of the people, the Jews, confident
no longer of safety, again sought rchigc under the Dutch.
This time they found their way to Anicnca. These were
joined by Jews from the Dutch island of Cura^oa.

The Jews for the mosi part sculcd in New Amsterdam
and other places along the seaboard. Many of them found
dietr way to Philadelphia, where some of them became
estimable citizens. Among them was Haym Salomon,
who did much toward financing the American Revolution.
He negotiated the war subsidies secured from France and
Holland, and served as paymaster-genend for the forces of
the latter country in the United States. Furthermore, he
advanced money to the agents and ministers of the United
States in foreign countries, as well as to statesmen and

others at home. The United States borrowed ^5600,000
of him in specie, of which ^5400,000 had not been paid at
the time of" his death. His descendants have attempte d
re{&gt;eacedly to induce Congress to repay the loan, but without
success.

Stuyvesant looked with anxiety upon the arrival of so
many Jews into his dominion. He succeeded in making it
so uncomfortable for them that many left and sought refuge
in Rhode Ishuid. He had written a remonstrance to the
Dutch West India Company and had pleaded *^that none of
the Jewish nation be permitted to infest New Netfaerknd."
Instead of compljring with his request, the Company le-
buked the director for his unfairness* Furthermore, the
States General, by an act of July 15, 1655, expressly gave
the Jews permission to trade to New Netherland, and to
reside there on the simple condition that they should support
their own poor.

When the Dutch were conquered hy the English, and
the Duke of York came into possession of New Nether-
lands this policy of toleratuMi w as continued. As a result
of this, the Jewish population rapidly increased and many of
them became rich. In 1748, they enjoyed all rights that
other citizens possessed, save that of voting for the members
of the legislatuie* The Assembly of 1737 put itself on
record in regard to this privilege. A contested election case
came up before the Assembly, and one of the parties pro-
tested that the Jews had been allowed to vote. The ques-
tbn was settled by the Assembly deciding that Jews had no
riglit to vote in New York, since the same privilegie was not
granted them in England.

The Waldensian Church is probably the oldest Protestant
church in the world. The Waldensian valleys are in the
north of Italy in the midst of the Cottian Alps, about thirty
miles southwest of the city of Turin, the capital of Pied-
mont. The history of the Waldenses is that of repeated
persecutions by the Roman Catholics. In 1655 occurred
their most severe persecution. An army, composed partly

of French troops of Louis -XIV* and partly of Irish soldierEi
entered the valleys and treated the people with frightful bai^
bariUN, Destruction was spread on every side. Invited by
the Elector Palatine, some of the persecuted Waldenses
nuule their way to the Palatinate, while others went on to
Holland. Still others wishing to go to the Delaware, Jacob
Alricks was directed to purcluse all the land between South
River and the comer of North River. During the admin-
istration of Stuyvesant, in 1662, nuuiy Waldenses settled
on Staten Island. Later, a number settled in what is now
Pennsylvania.

Jean de Labadie, a Frenchman, was the founder of the
sect to which has been given his name. He was born in

1610, and was educated by the Jesuits at Bordeaux. He
left the Jesuits in 1639. l ater, he became a Calvinist, but
in the end, hnding no sect quite to his mind, he founded
one. Labadie's doctrines were a combination of mysti-
cism and Calvinism. He held that illumination by the
Holy Ghost was the means of salvation, even superseding
the Bible. He rejected infant baptism and the observance
of the Sabbath, and taught communism in [Muperty. On
account of their peculiar doctrines, the i^abadists were ex-
pelled from Holland and ultimately settled at Wiewerd in
Friesland.

In 1679 they sent two of their members, Peter Sluyter
and Jasper Dankers, to America ^ to look for a suitable spot
to plant a colony." They landed in New York and there
made a disciple of Ephraim Herman, eldest son of Augus-
tine Herman, who owned a vast tract of land in what is now
CecU County, Maryland. In company with Ephraim Her-
man, they visited the elder Herman at his large estate at the
head of Chesapeake Bay, which he called, in honor of his
fatherland, Bohemia Manor. There they were kindly re-
ceived, and, though for a time they continued their journey
down the peninsula, they soon returned to the manor and
purchased of Augustine Herman three or four thousand acres
of land. They then journeyed back to Wiewerd, but in




196 MWDIB STAtBS AND MARTUND



1683 returned ag^ to the land they had purchased. They
brought with them a colony of fellow believers and settled
upon this land. Peter Sluyter set himself at the head of
affairs and ruled in a rather arbitrar)' manner. In 1698 the
colony was divided, and in 1722 Shivter died.

George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, having embraced
the Roman Catholic religion, determined to found a colony
in America where all the [)crsccuted of his faith in England
could find a refuge and could enjoy the privilege of wor-
shipping as they pleased. At that time the Catholics in
England were fined £20 a month for not attending the
services of the EstabUsbed Cburcb. Tbis law was not
always strictly enforced, but large sums were frequently
esctorted by tbe government from the Catholics by way of
compromise.

Gleorge Calvert died before receiving the charter of the
giant of land which he had received from tbe king. It
was left to his son, Cecilius Calvert, to carry out the plan
which his father had conceived. Again receiving a grant
to the territory north of the Potomac, he called it Maryland
in honor of Queen Henrietta Maria. In 1633, ^^"^
his brother Leonard with a party of three hundred persons
to colonize his new possessions. They landed at the mouth
of the Potomac and founded the town of St. Mary's. Lord
Baltimore wished to make Maryland an asylum for the
oppressed not only of his own sect but of other sects bc-
sidies. Consequently his charter granted religious freedom
to all, and permitted the people from tbe first to take part
in making dieir own laws.

In tbe other English colonies, tbe Catholics were usualljr
deprived of many of tbe privileges granted to their fellow
citizens. Even in Pennsylvania, where one would look for
religious toleration, they were legislated against after Penn
regained his province. In the third charter, issued in 1696,
there appeared an oath of allegiance required of all persons
about to become public officers. Thh oath imposed a rejec-
tion of the doctrines taught by the Roman Catholic Church,

Thifly of course^ was equivalent to exclusion from office of
all Catholics. However, there were but few of that fiuth

in Pennsylvania at that time,

Leisler, who had usurped power in New York after the
overthrow of Andros, made the anti-Catholic feeling in
the colony an excuse for many of his high-handed acts.
The reign of James II. had filled the hearts of the colonists
with a dread of Roman Catholic supremacy. Dongan had
been a Catholic and had placed men of that faith in office.
Nevertheless, he was a broad minded man, and it is prob-
able the Catholics had no more than their share of prefer-
ment. At any rate, there were not enough Catholics in
New York to warrant a charge of conspiracy bang brought
against them, nor the annoyances to which they were
subjected during Leisler's usurpation. When Sloug|iter
became Governor of New York^ the charter, annulled
during the reign of James II., was reenacted with the
exception *^of the rig^t to worship according to the Romish
Religion."

In Maryland, Jesuit priests, who had gone out to work
among the Indians, received as gifts from them large tracts
of land which, of course, became the property of the Jesuit
order. I'he priests, moreover, dwelling in the wilderness,
were freed from the statute law. They even claimed not
to be amenable to the common law and held themselves
answerable onlv to the canon hiw and to ecclesiastical tri-
bunals. This view did nut hi in with Lord Baltimore's
idea that all colonists were subject to the same laws. He
foresaw that the enforcement of this principle was Hkelv to
bring him into conflict with the Jesuit order. Nevertheless,
he took a prompt and a decisive step. He petitioned Rome
to remove the Jesuits from the missions and put in their
places prefect and secular priests. This request was granted,
and an order removing the Jesuit priests was issued by the
Propaganda. Then again, in the new ^'Conditions of
Plantation,*^ which he issued in 1 64 1 , two of the sections
provided that ^ no lands should be g^nted to, or held by, any

corporation or society, ecclesiastical or temporal, without
special license from the Proprietary/'

To bring about a final settlement of the afl&amp;ir, the Jesuits,
the governor, and Secretary Lewger met in conference.
As a result, the whole question of the attitude of the Roman
Catholic Church in Maryland toward the proprietary gov-
ernment was submitted to the Provincial of England. A
memorial was sent at the same time to the Propaganda,
protesting against the hardship of removing those who had
borne all the burden and heat of the day, just as they were
beginning to reap some fruit of their labors.'* Shortly after,
Father Moore, the Provincial, decided the dispute in favor
of Lord Baltimore and executed a release of all the lands
acquired by the society from the Indians. T.ord Baltimore,
having carried his point, the order for the removal of the
Jesuit priests was thereupon rescinded (Browne).

Many of the Puritans, driven from other colonies, found
a refuge in Maryland, where they repaid the proprietary's
kindness by hatching numerous plots against his authority.
After Cromwell dissolved Parliament and proclaimed him-
self Protector, although the cuith of allegiance to* the pro-
prietary remained the same, the Puritans refused to take
it by reason of Baltimore's being a Catholic. We have
already referred to the fact that Bennett and Claiborne, glad
of an excuse to injure the proprietor, gathered a force from
Virginia and Maryland and took possession of the govern-
ment at St. Mary's. A General Assembly was called, but
no Catholic was allowed to cast a vote, or be elected a
member. The statute of 1649 was repealed, which granted
religious freedom to all Christians, and instead a law was
passed which denied permission to Catholics to worship in
Maryland. The Assembly went even further and declared
that Lord Baltimore no longer had any rights whatever in
the colony he himself had founded. The rank injustice of
this act can be realized when we recall the fact that the
proprietor had invited to his province many of the people
who now turned against him. Protestant Dissenters and

Quaken wen exempted from all penaldet and dinbilitkt,
and were given the privilege of having separate meeting

houses, provided they paid a poll tax of £^0 to support
the Establishment) — the Protestant Episcopal Church. As
for the Catholics^ it is perbnps needless to add that they
were not included in this amnesty.

Let us now turn our attention to the persrc utcd ot
another European nationality, who, as a result of the devas-
tation of their country by lyouis XIV., poured into America
in a steady stream, beginning with the year 1708. They
were the Palatines of the Rhenish Palatinate.

There were two Palatinates, the Upper, or Bavarian, and
the Lower, or Palatinate of the Rhine. Only the latter need
concern us. This Palatinate became Protestant in the year
1559, when Frederick IIL marked his accession to the
electocal dignity by deliiiitely associating himself and his
house with the Reformed or Calvinistic Chtifch. By reason
of its location it was early brought in contact with the
Lutheian and Calvinistic doctrines*

The personal religion of the Elector of the lUatinate was
indeed a matter of importance^ lor the attempt was some*
times made by the ruler to force his religion upon the
country. Consequently, when John William, of the House
of Neuburg, became Elector in 1690, he tried to bring the
Palatinate and its people under allegiance to the Roman See.
The bigotry of John William and his persecutions were
among the causes of the exodus of the Palatines from their
homes. Of greater importance, however, than this were
the devastations of the Palatinate in 1674 and if)S8 and the
War of the Grand Alliance and the War of ihv Spanish
Succession that swept over tliat unhappy country from 1689
to 1713.

The Revocation of the Edict of N mtrs by Louis XIV.,
October 22, 1685, drove many Hu^ntnots to the Palatinate.
This brought the wrath of that king down upi&gt;n the little
electorate. He ordered his gcncraU to make the ralalinate
a desert. 1 hicc days were given for the inhabitants to leave

the country. Thousands fled to other parts of Kurope. The
Palatinate was laid waste. During the War of the Spanish
Succession the Palatinate again suffered desolation. In fact,
the depredations of Marshal MUars, in 1707, were so wide-
spread that the inhabitants could no longer exist upon the
land. It was then that the great exodus began that brought
so inanj Pkladnet to America.

The exodus was conducted as secretly as possible, for the
elector opposed the movement. As a result, we have no
trustworthy account of the first emigntionsi but it is quite
probable die fugitives went to New Jersey. Among the
first pioneers, howc vcr, was a noteworthy company of forty-
one members. They went first to England, in 1 708, and
thence to America. They were under the leadership of the
clergyman Kockerthal, and came over to New York with
Lord Lovelace. The fjr^ ater part of this company were
farmers. All were Lutherans. At a later date, Kocker-
chal made a trip to the Palatinate and brought back others
of his countrymen. The severe winter of 1708—1709 in
the Palatinate drove others from their homes^ and of these
some came to America.

When the Palatinate exodus really began in earnest, thou-
sands suddenly swept down upon England and Holland.
One of the emigpmts says of it: ^A migrating epidemic
seized on the striclcen people and, as a wave, thirty thousand
Germans washed along the shores of England. Israel was
not more astounded at the armored carcasses of the Egyp"
tians lying on the banks of the Red Sea, than were the people
of England at this immense slide of humanity." The gov-
ernment of England was forced to care for this impoverished
army of refugees. They began to arrive in London in May,
I 709, and before the end of Ortoher thirteen thousand had
arrived. London was unable to provide for their wants.
The question then arose of what should be done with
them. The Parish Laws of England would not permit their
being absorbed in the counties of England. Final! v, the
question was settled by sending them to America, pruvisiuu

bdng made by the English govemmetit for their tcmtpoita^
tion and for subsistence upon their arrival.

At this time there was a vacancy in the governorship of
New York. Robert Hunter was appointed to fill it. He
proposc-d to the Lords of Trade in November, 1709, to
take over with hi 111 to New York three thousand of the
Palatines, to be employed in the production of naval stores.
It was thought, furthermore, that tlic pints in the Hudson
and Mohawk valleys could furnish England fofevcr ^vith
tar and turpentine. Hunter thought the Palatines wt)uld
add greatly to the defence oi New York against the French
and Indians. The government granted Hunter 0,000 for
the project.

In January, 1710, Hunter set out for New York with
these P^datiiiet in ten ships. It is estimated that there were
at least three thousand of them* So crowded were the ships
that at least five hundred died on the wajr* Dehiyed by
storms and cootraiy winds, they did not arrive at New York
until June. One of the diips, the Htrhri^ was cast away
on the east end of IxMig Ishmd, but only a loss of goods
was suiimd. The wreck of this ship gave rise to the well-
known legend of the Palatine Ship and Light." Tradition
avers that the vessel was decoyed ashore with false beacons
by the islanders, 1^0 rifled and burned it. As this legend
runs, light is at times seen from the Island upon the
surfi^ of the ocean, which in its form has suggested to
the imagination a resemblance to a burning ship under full
sail; and it is called the Palatine Light and Palatine Ship."
—(Cobb, St'-jrv of the Palatines?)

thinking there might be contagious diseases aboard, decided
to build huts for them on Nutten Island, now Governor's
Island. They rcmamcd here for five months. The authori-

for himself. This action on the part of the authorities
caused considerable discontent among the Palatines. Hunter
sent surveyors along Mohawk and Schoharie Rivers to lay
out settlements. They soon rt purred that the lands along
the Schoharie were good, but that there were no pines.

Consequently, in October, 1 7 10, Hunter, for ^266, pur-
chased six thousand acres of land along Hudson River from
Robert Livingston. This area not being sufficient, an ad-
ditional tract of land, belonging to the crown, of eight
)uHi(]rcd acres on the west side of the river was purchased.
Most of th'e Palatines were settled in five villages on these
tracts of land. Later, this number was increased to seven.
About four hundred of the emigrants, mostly widows, single
women, and children, remained in New York. These vil-
lages were familiarly known to the Palatines as East Camp
and West Camp, names which still exist. The east side
ciact stretched sixteen miles along the Hudson and twenty-
four miles to the eastward to the Massachusetts line. Its
population was one thousand two hundred, but the number
of the able-bodied men capable of working was not large.
Winter came on without their being prepared, and there
was much suflnering from want of proper and sufficient food.

The Palatines soon looked upon their lot as but very little
short of slavery. They were ill treated by the agents of
the governor. They became disgusted with the manufacture
of tar. They complained that the land allotted to them was
insufficient to permit provision for their children who might
survi\'c thcin. The people in the immediate neighborhood
aroused their discontent by glowing descriptions of the fine
lands along the Schoharie. Very soon the Palatines became
mutinous, and (Tovcrnor Hunter was called upon the scene.
The malcontents plainly told him the land was unfit for
them and that they wished to remove to the Schoharie.
They claimed that they had been cheated by the agents; that
many of England's promises to them had not been kept;
that they were willing to fulfil their contract, but positively
refused to remain where they were any longer. The governor

set forth the difficulty of settling on the Schoharie by leaaon

of the (bn^cr from the Indians.

ScciTiiii'^lw, peace was e&lt;;tab!ishcd, hut as soon as the gov-
ernor (IcpLirtL'd conditions trrcw worse than they had been
heforc. Hunter's patience being quite exhausted, he sent
Some soldiers under Colonel Nicholson to coerce them into
submission. Some of the settlers having armed themselves,
they were forthwith arrested and disarmed by the soldiers.
The cmtinous Pahitmes then betook themselves quietly to
the villages. For the time being the insurrection uas ai an
end. They worked all through the following summer, and
only occasional murmurs arose.

In die fidl. Hunter ettabliihed a comt over them and
ttationed troops in the immediate vicinity. But in 17 12
his funds ran out and he was compelled to suspend all work.
The Palatines were given permissbn to scatter wherever
they wished, on condition that they did not go outside of
New York and New Jeney. They immediately took ad-
vantage of this concession. There was no general plan of
action. Perhaps a third remained where they were, hut the
majority of them betook themselves toward *^the promised
land of Schoharie." They had already sent out a party of
seven men under Weisler to the Schoharie, to spy out the
land and to deal with the Indians. They lepoited on the
condition of the country, and within two weeks preparations
were made for a general exodus.

In due time, thcv nrrived on the Schoharie and settled in
seven villa^Tcs named in honor of their seven leaders. They
soon experienced troubles with Colonel Nicholas Ravard
and other claimants with respect to their titles to the land.
It was not, in fact, until 1725, five years after Hunter's
departure for England, that their titles to the land were
conhrmed. Prior to this settlement, houcver, there were
numberless disputes between the Palatines and other claim-
ants to the soil. When Sheriff Adams attempted to make
arrests he found himself confronted with a moh of women,
led by Magdalena Zeh. The sheriflF was knocked down.

beaten, and dragged through the vWe^t puddles of their barn&gt;

yards. He was then put on a rail and ridden " Skimmington **
through ihc SLulcnicnts, a distance of seven miles or more.
Finally, he was left on a bridge, well out on the road to
Albany.

When Burnet became governor, he was directed to look
after the Palatines and to settle them upon lands of which
a disposition had n ot as yet been made. The governor
considered the advisability of settling them in the i\It)hawk:
valley, where they would prove a barrier against the French.
This plan was not at all displeasing to at least some of the
Palatines. There were three divisions among them: one
division wished to stay where they were ; anofSer wished to
emigrate to Pennsylvania $ and a third wished to go to the
Mohawk. The Pabcines along the banks of the Mohawk
were joined in 1722 by the major part of a shipload of
their fellow countmnen newly arrived in New York. This
incneased the number in the Mohawk valley to over three
htmdred persons. A patent of one hundred acres was
granted to these Palatines in 1725. It was a free gfant,
subject only to the usual quitrents. For thirty years, under
this patent) they lived unmolested and prospered greatly
in this fertile valley of the Mohawk. Settlements grew up
and forts and trading posts were established. Among these
settlements were the two towns of Palatine and Palatine
Bridge. Many of those who came over in 1722 settled in
the neighborhood of the latter town. The level meadows
along the south side of Mohawk Ri\er came to be called
the "GcrmaJi Flats." They were unsurpassed in fertility.
Just opposite, on the north side of the river, was the settle-
ment of Herkimer, named after the most celebrated general
of the Palatines. On all sides of the German Flats, Palatine
settlements sprang up.

The signal failure of Hunter's philanthropic scheme can-
not be blamed upon the Palatines. Hunter miscalculated the
tar ami tmpentiiic producing capacity of the pines along
the Hud:»un. Even if the English treasury had continued

to support Hunter and if the settlers had remained docile,
the scheme could not have succeeded. The pines along the
Hudson were not tar-bearing trees. Then, again, the Eng-
lish government shamcfullv abandoned the governor and his
wards. The ;^lo,ooo granted him was exhausted even
before the Palatines reached the Hudson. After that, he
had to support the colonistt out of his own pocket. He
paid Livingston for the land with his own money. In all,
he lost ^£^20,000 in the scheme. Later, he went to Eng-
land to make a personal appeal to the government for reim-
bursement,, but we have no record that justice was ever
done him.

Pabtines settled in Maryland, in what is now Frederick
County, as early as 1 710. To encourage their immigration
the Assembly exempted them from paying public levies.
They did not come in large numbers, however, until 1729
or 1730. Charles Calvert offered many advantages to per-
suade them to settle in Maryland. In 1 735, Daniel Dulaney
oflered inducements to them if a hundred families would settle
on some of his land. In 1 749, provision was made for a
much larger number of them. The immigration increased
so rapidly that in 1774 Frederick. Count)- had a population
of nearly fiftv thousand. This was about one-seventh of the
population of the whole province.

The Palatines on the Schoharie having heard flattering
reports of the fertile lands on the Tulpchocken and the
Swatara, about one-third of them emigrated to Pennsylvania.
Governor Keith did what he could to encourage them to
take up lands in those parts. At least sixty families emigrated
in the spring of 1723, and still other families left in 1728.
To the first settlement they gave the name Heidelberg. All
were treated with the kindest consideration by the Pennsyl-
vania authorities. This treatment led many others to settle
along the Susquehanna and its tributaries. For twenty
years beginning with 171 7 there was a steady stream of
Palatines coming into Pennsylvania. Many of them came
directly from the Pahtinate. By 1740, their number must



2o6 MIDDLB STATES AND MAKYLAHD



have been at least fifty thousand. Coming over without any
means whatever, they were often sold in Philadelphia at

auction to sen'c for a term of years. They thus received
the name " Redemptioners." Thev usually gave three or
five years of service, which brought about £\o at auction.
Many afterward became wealthy. In 1755, the Peimsy!-
vania Assembly passed a bill limiting the emigiration of Pala-
tmes, but it was vetoed by the governor 011 the ground of its
being inhuman.

This mass of German settlers in Pennsylvania, being
thrown so close together, naturally retained their customs.
Being so fxx from the place of their birth, their language
soon degenerated into a patois — a mixture of South Ger-
man with £nglish. This dialect or patois is commonly
called " Pennsylvania Dutch." It is still spoken by some
of the inhabitants of central Pennsylvania. It flourishes
around the cities of Lancaster, York, Reading, AUentown,
Easton, Lebanon, and Harrisburg.

Jonathan Dickson, in writing about the Palatines, says:
"We had a parcel," — meaning the Palatines, — "who came
out about five years a^o and proved quiet and industrious."
The Palatines, and liltewise the other German settlers, were
industrious, economical, patriotic, and religious. 1 lieu eager-
ness to work overcame all opposition to their migration into a
country. They possessed moral earnestness, soberness of
mind, persistency, and staying qualities* Tliej were deter-
mined to improve themselves. afnl their fortune, and to enjoy
freedom of worship, Benjamin Franklin, in 1766, said the
Germans made up one-third of the one hundred and sixty thou-
sand whites in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, that they were
" a people who brought with them the greatest of all wealth —
industry and integri^ and characters that had been supervised
and developed by years of sufiering and persecution."

Governor Thomas, in his address to the Council, said:
"This province has been for some years the asylum of the
distressed Protestants of the Paiatmate and other parts of
Germany, suid I believe it may with truth be said that the

present flourishing condition of it U in a great measure
owing to the industry of those people ; and should any dis-
couiagement divert them from coming hither, it may well
be apprehended that the value of your lands will fall and
your advance to wealth be much slower." Among these
German settlers and their descendants were men prominent
in the French and Indian War, and in the Revolutionary
War. They sent whole companies to the front. Their
frontier settlements were bravely defended against the cnemv.
They saved many an interior town from the ravagings and
burnings of the enemy. They delved into the soil and
opened up iron mines, and established forges and furnaces.
Forests were cut down, and in their places settlements and
fium lands sprang up. They supplied the needs of the
ever increasing new arrivals and paved the way for other
settlements to the west of them.

The Treaty of Utrecht, 1713, ^ve the province of Acadia
to England. But the people were mostly French, and the
£nglish government was really only a military occupation
of the peninsula. At the time of the French and Indian
War there were more than sixteen thousand inhabitants
in the province. The g;overnor, Lawrence, pretending to
fear an insurrection, urged Braddock and the colonial gov-
ernors to strengthen the English rule over the French in-
habitants. Accordingly, an expedition was fitted out with
I&gt;awrence at the head. In less than a month the English
were complete masters of the province.

Tlie French inhabitants, however, outnumbered the Eng-
lish, and, in order to balance the unequal population, Law-
rence and some others in authority concocted the scheme
of driving the French from their homes. Their estates
were confiscated, their towns were burned, and they them-
selves were driven into exile and scattered throughout the
English colonies. The histoiy of civilized nations hardly
furnishes a parallel to this wanton and wicked destruction
of an inoffensive colony. In 1755, many of them were
sent to Annapolis, Maryland, and from there to the different

counties of the province. Their lot was a hard one. They
were treated as prisoners of war, and yet were deprived of

the hope of exchange or release. People could not be in-
duced to employ them, and yet were "irritated at their
wretchedness and destitution." Their only friend in the
provmce seems to have been a merchant of Oxford, Talbot
County, Maryland, Henry Caliister, who assisted them in
many ways.

In 1734, on account of the persecutions to which they
were subjected at liome, some iMoravians came to America,
and settled in Geuigia. There they remained until 1740,
when the Spanish war broke out j and as their religion would
not permit them to bear arms, they went to Pennsylvania,
whm they founded Bethlehem and, later on, Nazareth.

The Tunkers are a sect of German-American Baptists —
called by themselves Brethren." Their name is sometimes
erroneously spelled ^Dunkers" and ^Dunkards/' but it
comes from the German tunken^*^ to dip." The sect is said
to have been founded by Alexander Mack, at Schwarzenau
in Westphalia, in 1708* They came to America because
of persecutions in Germany and settled in Geimantown,
and chose Joseph Becker, a weaver, to be their minister.
The **Sieben Taeger," or German Seventh Day Baptists,
are an olFshoot of the Tunkers. They settled in 1732 at
Ephrata, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, under Conrad
Beissel. They dressed like monks and nuns, and used a
vegetable diet. They might marry, but if they did so they
were obliged to leave the settlement at Ephrata. Some of
them afterward moved to Ohio, Indiana, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, and several other States. The denomination is now
well-nigh extinct. The Tunkers have increased in num-
bers. This denomination should not be confused with the
Mennonite, the Aniish, the Schwenkfelder, and other peace
sects, though these sects have one common quality: the
quiet and peaceable lives led by their members. Because
of this they have sometimes been called ^^the Harmless
People."

MIGRjnON OF THE OPPkBSSED



We have thus shown to what a great extent the Middle
colonics furnished the oppressed of nanj lands and many
creeds a safe retreat from the persecutions to which they
had heen subjected in their native countries. In no other
part of North America was liberty of conscience granted to
the same degree during the colonial period. The victims
of a relentless persecution for the sake of their religious
beliefs, the Dutch had adopted a policy of hroad toleration
for all sects. They made it the policy ot the govern-
ment of New Netherland, and the English followed their
good example after the conquest of that province. In
consequence, New ^"ork harbored a mixed population of
manv creeds, — Walloons, Puritans, Huiriunuts, Quakers,
Lutherans, Jews, Waldcnj.es, Roman Catholics, and Pala-
tines. Lord Baltimore's experiment was in behalf of the
persecuted Roman Catholics j but other colonists were wel-
comed, and we find settled within the borders of Mary-
land, Labadists, PuritanSf and Palatines. William Penn's
'^Holy Experiment" was primarily in behalf of the op-
pressed Friends; but the persecuted of all creeds were
invited to Pennsylvania upon an equality with the followers
of George Fox. Accordingly, Mennonites, Lutherans,
Waldenses, Palatines, Moravians, and Tunkers came in
great numbers. Likewise, New Jersey was settled largely
by the Friends, but the oppressed of other colonies were
welcomed within its borders. Undoubtedly there were
some persecutions, as we have shown in the case of Stuy-
vesant against the Quakers, the Lutherans, and the Jews,
and the Puritans against the Roman Catholics in Maryland.
For the most part, however, such oppression was decidedly
the exception to the rule and attracts our attention because
of that fact. Nothing, therefore, we may say, is more
characteristic of the Middle colonies during the period under
consideration than the uniform toleration of the religious
beliels of all classes of the population. The Middle colo-
nics in this respect present a plcasuig contrast to the other
sections of the country during this period.

CHAPTER IX
LORD BAirmORE'S EXPERIMENT, 1632-1685

• Ch£sapeake Bay, which divides Maryland into the
£a$tem and Western Shore, is the largest bay or inlet in
the territoiy of the United States. It extends two hun-
dred miles north and south and varies in width from ten to
twenty miles. The land gradually rises toward the west*
The central portions of the State and the mountainous
valleys beyond arc very fertile. The greatest elevation is in
the mountains of the Blue and Alleghany Ridges, which
traverse the extreme western portions of the State from
northeast to southwest.

It is a peculiarity of the present State of Maryland that,
though small and narrow, it unites a great variety of soil,
climate, geological structure, flora, and fauna. Chesapeake
Bay itself "draws tribute from an extraordinary range of
country and climate. While one of its arms touches the
foot of the Catskill, and almost reaches to the Adirondacks,
another pierces to the heart of the Alleghanies due west-
ward, and a third flows with a turbulent stream through the
Blue Ridge hard by the Peak of Otter." It is diflicult to
overestimate the Importance of Chesapeake Bay in the
development of Maxyland. It was the greatest source of
wealth to the colonists. One could travel by means of it
from place to place with ease. This was a most important
condition when we come to consider the fact that the
roads of the country were undeveloped and, in most cases,

even unbuilt. Out of the waters of the bay they brought
fish, oysters, and crabs; on hs banks they found all kinds
of fowl. It was, indeed, the first settlers' most valuable
possession. No one took up lands that did not border on
its waters. In a word, we may say that the numerous
tributaries of the Chesapeake, navigable in many instances
to their very sources; the unsurpassed fertility of the soil
drained by its waters; the unexcelled means of sustaining
life offered by the bay itself — all combined to make this part

• of the eastern seaboard no less well adapted for colonization
purposes than the valleys of the Hudson and the Delaware.

Roman Catholics, persecuted in England, looked for a
home in a remote possession of Great Britain where they
might worship free from persecution. George Calvert, the
first Baron of Baltimore, projected the plan of opening an
"asylum for conscience." He was prevented by death from
the execution of his plan, but his son, Cccilius Calvert, carried
it on. The elder Calvert seems to have taken a profound
interest in the plans for American colonization at quite an
early date. He was one of the couni illors of the New
England Company and, in 1609, v\ ris a nu^mber of the Vir-
ginia Company. Afterward, at the revocation of the charter
of the latter, he was appointed one of the Provisional
Council for the government of the province. In 1620 he
purchased from Sir William Vaughan a patent covering the
southeastern peninsula of Newfoundland. This was the
charter of Avalon, and, differing but slightly from that of
Maryland, evidently served as a model for it. In 1627,
Baltimore visited his colony, and the following year brought
over a part of his family and some colonists, making in all

' about a hundred souls. - The hostility of the French from
without and the Puritans from within to no little extent
caused, the failure of this colonizing attempt. Odvert's for-_
tune was seriously impaired and his health fatally undermined
as a result of the experiment.

In the meantime, however, Calvert, now Lord Baltimore,
had received information of the flourishing condition of the

LORD BAirmORE S EXPERIMENT



Virginia colony. On October i, 1629, he arrived at James-
town with his wife and several children and some forty
colf)nists, in search of a desirable situation to make a settle-
ment. The colonists there gave hmi by no means a cordial
reception, having, no duubt, received some intimation of his
colonial designs. He was tendered the oaths of supremacy
and allegiance, but being a Catholic he refused to take them.
He recognized only the Pope as spiritual head. Never-
theless, to avoid provoking bad feeling, he offered to take a
modified form of the oath. They were unwilling to accept
this offer. The Virginia Council could not admit one to
their settlement who would not acknowledge all the preroga-
tives of his majesty, and so requested him to depart in the
next ship. He was offered insults and some of the rabble
even attempted to do him personal violence.

Disappointed in finding a residence in Virginia, Lord
Baltimore now turned his attention to the neighboring terri-
toiy. His eyes fell upon the region along Chesapeake Bay,
as yet unsettled. Its situation and fertility led him to a
closer inspection. Here he decided to try to obtain a home
for religious freedom. He left for England, leaving his wife
and children behind. Upon his arrival, he found a letter
frpm the king advising him to "desist from further prose-
cuting his designs and to return to his native country.**
The king would not permit him to return to America, but
granted him permission to send for his wife and children.
The vessel on which they sailed was cast away and they
were lost.

On his return to England, Lord Baltimore had made an
application for a grant of territory lying to the southward of
James River, in Virginia, between that river and the bounds
of Carolina. Charles grained his leijuest, on account of
his past services, his unimpeachable reputation, and the
favor with which he was held by himself and his father,
James L, before him.

The charter was prepared and signed in February, 1631.
The territory comprised the northern part of North Carolina

and the southern part of Virginia as far north as James
River. Francis West, once governor, William Claiborne,
secrctiiry , and William TurkeT, one of the Council of
Virginia, objected to the plant inL^ of the colony within the
limits of Virginia. To avoid any difficulty, I&gt;ord Balti-
more requested his majesty to grant him in lieu thereof
some part of the continent to the northward. The request
was granted. Lord Baltimore drew up a charter, modelled
on that of Avalon, with his own hand, leaviiig a blank for
the name. It is said he intended the name should be
" Crcscciiua," or the land of Crcscence, most probably as a
name of " good omen for its growth and prosperity.** Again,
others hold that it may have been in honor of Crescentius, a
consul^ who in the tenth centuiy attempted to throw oiF the
German yoke and to restore the ancient republic. Charles
asked his lordship what he should call the colony. Liord
Baltimore replied that he should like to name it in honor
of the king, but was deprived of that privilege inasmuch as
his name had already been given to Carolina. Charles sug-
gested M Mariana," but Lord Baltimore objected, saying it
was the name of a Jesuit priest who had written condemning
monarchy. Charles then proposed Terra Mariae,** in honor
of Queen Henrietta Maria. This name was consequently
inserted in the charter. Before the patent had received the
impression of the Great Seal, Lord Baltimore died, April
15, 1632. His health seems to h.tve been broken by the
rigors of the inhospitable climate of Newfoundland. His
eldest son, Cccilius Calvert, succeeded him. To him
the Maryland charter was issued, and it bears the date
of June 20, 1632.

This charter was of the most liberal character. By its
provisions, Baltimore and his heirs were made the proprie-
taries of the territory, which, like the See of Durham in
England, was to be a palatinate. This made it equivalent
to a principahty, and the prerogatives of its proprietor were
well-nigh regal, the crown reserving to itself merelv a
feudal supremacy. The proprietor was only required to

pay to the king z yearly rent of two Indian arrows, in
acknowledgment of his feudal subordination. In addition
to this, he bound himself to pay a fifth portion of whatever
gold or silver might be discovered in the province. He
owned the soil and was, in fact, absolute lord of the land
and water within the boundaries of his province. He could
erect towns, cities, and ports, and could levy taxes and collect
tolls and duties. He could exercise both the civil and mili-
tary powers of a sovereign. For example, he could confer
titles and dignities under a system of subinfeudation; he
could make war or peace ; call out the whole fighting popu*
lation and declare martial law. He could constitute courts,
from which there was to be no appeal, and could appoint
judges, magistrates, and other civil officers. He could
even make the laws with the assent of the majority of the
freemen, or of their representatives. Tn cases of cmcrirrncy,
he could enact laws himself, provided they did not impair
life, limb, or property. Furthermore, he could execute the
laws and pardon otit rulcrs. His subjects were exempted
from regal taxation. When doubtful points were at issue,
it was provided that in their interpretation they should be
construed in the sense most favorable to the proprietary.

Certain rights were guaranteed to the colonists. They
and their descendants were to remain English subjects, and
their right to go and come from England was not to be
abridged in any way. They could acquire, hold, and alienate
all kinds of property in England, and they ivete given the
privilege of trading freely with English or^ foreign ports.
They were given the privilege of accepting or rejecting laws
proposed by the proprietary.

The boundaries of the province were, in turn, precisely
defined. Its northern limit was the fortieth parallel; its
western and southwestern limit was a line running south
from this parallel to the furthest source of the Potomac and
thence by the western bank of that river to Chesapeake Bay ;
its southern boundary was a line crossing the bay and penin-
sula to the ocean ; its eastern boundary was the ocean, and

Delaware Bay and River. This included, of course, the
present State of Delaware, a part of Pennsylvania, and
probably a part of West Virginia.

The Virginia colonists opposed the Maryland charter
most bitterly. Some of the members of the old Virginia
C ompany protested against it as an invasion of their own
chaiLcr rights j others were nut at ail pleased at having
Maryland as a neighbor. The protests, nevertheless, were
unavailing. The Privy Coitncil, after a formal hearing,
decided in favor of Baltimore. Those who continued to
think they had grievances could have them r^ted by the
ordinary processes of the law.

Cecilius Calvert now fitted out two vessels, the Ark and
the Doviy to transport the colonists to their new home.
The Jri was of three hundred and fifty tons burden and
had been used to carry the first Lord Baltimore, his family,
and his colonists to Avalon. The Dove was a small vessel
of but fifty tons bunk n. Upon these two vessels were
loaded the supplies and implements for the new colony.
There were about twenty gentlemen and over two hun-
dred lal&gt; ling men and handicraftsmen in the expedition.
Probably most of the " gentlemen " were Roman Catholics
and most of the laborers and servants were Protestants.
Baltimore remamed behind, to defend his charter against
open and covert attacks. He placed the expedition under'
the command of his brother, Leonard Calvert. His younger
brother, Geofge, was likewise one of the company. The
Ark left Gravesend on the i8th of October, 1633, stopped
at the Isle of Wight to take on board two Jesuit fathers,
Andrew White and John Althain, and other colonists, and
finally sailed for America on the 2 2d of November. They
touched at Barbadoes, and on the 24th of February arrived
at Point Comfort, Virginia. Stopping here for over a week,
they sailed northwest and shortly reached the Potomac.
Near the mouth of this river, on an island to which they
gave the name St. Clement's, the colonists planted a cross
and celebrated their first Mass. it was on the day of the

Feast of the Annunciation, March 25, 1634, but New Year's
Day according to the calendar of that day.

From here the colonists sailed up the Potomac until they
reached a small tributary having a good harbor. This
they fixed upon as the site of their settlement. Henry
Fleete, a Virginian, who was fiuniliar with the country,
acted as guide to the expedition. From Father White's
letter to Mutius Vetellesetis, dated April, 1634, we have a
most interesting acrount of the determination of the site
of St. Mary's by a nicniher of the cx[)cdition. 1 he first
island we came to we called St. Clement's Island.
Go ng abuut nine leagues (that is, about twenty-seven
miles) from St. Clement's, we sailed into the mouth of a
river on the north side of the Potomac, which wc named
St. George's. This river (or rather, arm of the sea), like
the rhames, runs from south to north about twenty miles
before you come to fresh water. At its mouth are two
harbors capable of containing three hundred ships of the
larg^ size. We consecrated one of these to St. George;
the other, which is more inland, to the blessed Virgin Mary,"
At the latter point they landed and found an Indian town
called Yoacomaco. They made a peaceful arrangement
with the Indians to live in one part of the town and the
Indians in the other, and that at the end of the harvest time
th^ — the Indians — should leave, which they did. This the
Indians very readily agreed to, inasmuch as they had already
determined to abandon their lands and seek safer homes
elsewhere, having been harried to desperation by the hostile
Susquehannas to the north of them. Thus upon the 27th
of March, 1634, they took possession and called the town
Saint Maries."

The little colony was soon to experience trouble from a

quarter where it should have least expected it. Virginia
thought its rights had been invaded by the charter which
the king had granted Lord Baltimore. In consequence, as
St. Mary's grew and gave promise of prosperity, the enmity
of some Virginians increased almost in direct proportion.

Then, again, th^ objected to tlie proxhni^ of what tbef
termed ^^Popith*' settlements, and were lifcewise jealous of
the privileges of the fcee tnde with foreign ports which had
been granted to the new colony but had been denied them.

Vtrginia't jealousy and animosity for twenty years centred
around the claim of one man — William Claiborne's claim
to Kent Island. It has been said by many historians that 1
Virginia had established settlements under the authority of
Claiborne before the charter was granted to Baltimore. That
conse(juently, as the country granted to Baltimore was pre-
viously settled by Claiborne, the former's grant was void.
"But it seems," savs Bormnn (^History of Maryland^ i, 263),
"to be cxtraordinin \ , that although history recognizes this
objection a&lt;&gt; being trequently made, yet it furnishes no
authenric proof of the fact on which it is founded.**

Claiborne had hrst gone out to Virginia as a surveyor to
the Virginia colony in 1621, "to survey the plaiuers' land
aiui make a map of the country.** He acquired much real
pic»pcrty, and after tht revocatioji of the Virginia charter
became a mciuhcr of the Council. He was likewise ap-
pointed secretary of state for Virginia by the commission
which appointed Sir John Harvey governor whenever the
place should be made vacant. While secretary, Claiborne
had a fine opportunity for accomplishing his designs. He
had, in the meantime, embarked on several commercial enter-
prises. He had been in the habit of carry ing on a trade
with the Indians along the shores of the Chesapeake, and
Virginia gave him authority later to explore and make
discoveries along that bay. It was in connection with
this traffic that he acted as agent for a firm of London
merchants, Cloberry and Company. This authority thus
conferred upon him by Virginia gave him even better oppor-
tunities for enriching himself. It appears that he established
trading posts along the northern part of the bay. The first
was probably on the Isle of Kent.

When, in 1629, Lord Baltimore visited Virginia, he, it
may be presumed, mentioned his intention of obtaining

LORD BALTIMORM^S MXFMRiMJUiT



m grant along the Chesapeake. Claiborne was probably
alarmed at this project, for hb tnuling posts were in this
territoiy and any settlements he had made he considered to
be under Viiginia authority. Claiborne, therefore, obtained
from King Charles, May i6, 1631, a license^ to trade in
all seas, etc., in or near about those parts of America/' For
the more efiectual execution of this license, command was
also given to the governor to permit Claiborne and his com-
pany freely to repair aiul trade to and trade in all the
aforesaid parts, as they should think fit and their occasion
should require." Claiborne secured this license by repre-
senting to Sir William Alexander, the king's secretary of
state for Scotland, that he wished to promote a trade be-
tween New England, Nova Scotia, and Virginia. About
ten months afterward, Claiborne applied for a commission
from Harvey, Governor of V!ra;inia, " to sail and trartir unto
the adjoining plantations of the Dutch seated upon this
territory of America." A commission was granted him nn
March 8, 1632. By it he was authorized to trade with the
Dutch and English plantations, and, in fact, whcrcsover he
desired. By the same comnussion, all representatives of
the English government were ordered to render him any
assistance within their power.

It is quite obvious, I rum these two ct)niniissjons, that
neither mentions specifically or even refers in definite terms
to any pUiUations or settlements, or to any traliic in the
Chesapeake. It wouU sci ni^ then, that if Claiborne had
formed any settlements on the Isle of Kent or at the mouth
of the Susquehanna, they were unauthorized settlements
made under his license to trade and make discoveries in the
Chesapeake. When Liord Baltimore visited Virginia, it did
not occur to him that these were really authorized settle-
ments. Nor did it occur to him that they would be brought
forward as objectbns when he should apply for a charter.
Consequently, when he applied for this charter after returning
to England, he was probably honest when he represented the
territory aa hitherto unsettled.

We have already referred to the fact that shortly after
Baltimore's grant the planters of Virginia sent a petition to
the king&gt; whkh was acted upon in the Star Chamber, July 3,
1633. It was decided that Lord Baltimore should remain
in possession of thi«? grant and that the planters ^'•be left to
their remedies at law, if they had such." No doubt Clai-
borne took an active part in having this petition presented
to the king. Although he had received a license to trade,
this gave him no "right to the soil or to any jurisdiction
over it.'* Nor could he support his title on the eroiind
of prior occupancy. His license from the king wciu no
further than a permission to trade, which might have been
granted to a citizen of a foreign State. Claiborne had, it is
true, established a trading post on an island to which he
gave the name Kent Island instead of Winston's Island as
Captain John Smith had named it. Here he erected some
buikltngs — the capital being furnished by the Irondon mer-
chants. For lack of support by these merchants and by
reason of fear of the Indians, the post was almost upon the
point of extinction when the Mafyknd colonists established
themselves at St. Mary's.

Claiborne was soon notified that Kent Island was within
the limits of the Maiyland patent. Nevertheless, he refused
to recognize the authority of Lord Baltimore. Furthermore,
for the purpose of annoying and hurting the Iatter*s colony,
he incited the Indians against it by telling them the colonists
were Spaniards and had come to destroy them. The matter
was, of course, reported to Lord Baltimore at once by one
of his vessels returning to England. On the 4th of Sep-
tember he instructed Leonard Calvert that if Claiborne
would not recognize his authority, he was to seize and hold
him prisoner at St. Mar}'*s and, if possible, take possession
of the Isle of Kent. I'hc king at the same time ordered
Governor Harvey to afFord the Marylanders protection
against the Indians, to allow them free trade with Virginia,
and to assist them in all ways possible. He likewise com-
manded Baltimore not to interfere with Claiborne in the

cxeicite of hit privikges on Kent Island, thinking, no doubt,
that the ithwd was not within the boimdiuy of the Maryland
patent.

Ffiendly Ictten passed between Lord Balttmore and Gov^
emor Harvey of Virginia with regard to the afiatr, but Clai-
borne, in spite of this, did all he could to discourage the
new colony. He thought by doing this at the very begin-
ning he coidd exasperate the newcomers to such an extent
that they would abandon the enterprise. Afiaiis shortly
came to a crisis* In 1635, the Long Tail^ a pinnace belong-
ing to Claiborne, was captured by Captain Thomas Corn-
waleys for being a Virginia boat trading in the Chesapeake
waters without a Maryland license. Claiborne retaliated
by fitting out a boat, the Cockattice^ with thirty men from
Kent Island, which he placed under the command of Lieu-
tenant Ratcliffe Warren. Tu-o pinnaces, the St. Mnrpnrct
and the St. HcUn^ were thereupon ntled out by Governor
Leonard Calvert and placed under the command of Captain
Thomas Cornwalevs, with orders to proceed to Kent Island
and subdue ihc t clic liion. The hostile vi5.i,cls met, it seems,
on the 23d of April, 1635, in Pocomoke Rivei, on the
eastern shore of the bay, :iiul ftnight the first naval battle
upon the inland waters ol Anicnca. Claiborne's men iiied
the first shot, killing William Ashmore of the Maryland
force and wounding several others. Comwaleys's men re-
turned the fire, killing Lieutenant Warren, John Bellson,
and William Dawson. The Cukatnti then surrendered, and
the men were taken prisoners. Among those captured was
a certain Thomas Smith, gentleman," who was probably
second in command. We shall have occasion to recur to
him in another connection. On the loth of May another
conflict took phce in the harbor of the Pocomoke,and there
was, probably, further bloodshed.

The Virginians were very indignant at this treatment of
Claibome^s men, and believing Uovemor Harvey to be in
sympathy widi Governor Calvert's course they rebelled and
refused to recognize his authority. Harvey was compelled

222 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



to sail for England. After his defeat on the Pocomoke,
Claiborne gave up for a time at least his resistance to Cal-
vert and soon after took refuge in Virginia. Governor
Calvert made a requisition on the Virginia authorities for
the surrender of Claiborne, claiming he was a fugitive
from justice. The Virginia authorities refused to comply
with this rri|ucst. Claiborne soon after left for England
for the purpose oi having his atlairs adjusted there. George
Evelyn, who took his place, assumed charge of Kent aiid
Palmer Islands and recognized the authority of Calvert.
After repeated petitions to the king, but fining no redress
for his supposed wrongs, Claiborne returned to Virginia,
where he found his property had been forfeited to the gov-
ernment. He petitioned the Assembly to restore his estate,
but his request was refused. By the latter part of the
year 1637, Kent Island had been reduced to obedience.
Measures were then taken to extend the civil authority
over that part of the province. On December 30, 1637,
Gov emor Calvert issued a commission to Captain George
Evelyn, appointing him commander of the island. In spite
of this pacific move, however, in February, 1638, the
islanders became so unruly that the governor and Council
were compelled to send out an armed force to subdue its
inhabitants. As no reference is made to the hostilities that
followed, it is inferred that a satisfactory adjustment of the
trouble was effected. In 1640, Claiborne petitioned anew
to have his confiscated property restored to him, but this was
again refused.

While the colonists were experiencing considerable trouble
with the IiKlians and were arming themselves to protect their
interests and their lives, an additional burden was laid upon
their shoulders. Captain Richard Ingle, an associate of
Claiborne, and, as some termed him, "a pirate and a rebel,"
was discovered hovering about the settlement with an armed
ship. It was perfectly plain from his movements that he
was endeavoring to strengthen the hands of the disaffected.
Just prior to t&amp;, in April, 1643, Governor Calvert had

LORD BAirmORB^S MXfSRiMtMNT 223

sailed for England to confer with Loid Baltimore with
regard to the state of affiurs in Maryland. He appointed
Giles Brent to act as governor in his stead during his
absence. Brent ocdered Ingle's arrest. He was captured,
but soon escaped and joined Claiborne in his design agunst
the peace of the province. Governor Covert returned in
September, 1644, and found the province considerably
stirred up; in ^ict, Claiborne was actively engiged in hos-
tilities. Consequently, on January 1645, a proclamation
was issued declaring Claiborne and Richard Thompson, a
planter, enemies of the province, and prohibiting them from
trading with Kent Island.

Ahout 1642, Claiborne had been a p pi Mined treasurer for
life of the province of Virginia. The trouble at home be-
tween Parliament and the king was reflected in the prov-
inces. Claiborne, seeing the king's power waning, was not
slow to go over to the winning side. Lord Baltimore, on
the contrary, whu had always been a friend of the king and
had received many favors at his lund, was taitlitul to him.
This fidelity lu his king made Lord Baltimore's possessions
in the New World insecure, and Claiborne immediately
took advantage of it. He seized Kent Island in 1645 witlw
out trouble. With Ingle he invaded the Western Shoie.
St. Mary's was seized shortly afterward, and Governor Cal*
vert fled to Virginia for help. But it availed little, for the
insurgents overdirew the propiietaiy government, and for
nearly two years Claiborne and his faction held complete
sway.

During Chubome's supremacy those who were fiuthfiil
to the governor suffered in many ways. Many were driven
into exile, and those who remained were placed under heavy
fines and their property taken from them. Even the mis-
sionaries to the Indians did not escape. They were sent to
England in chains, where they were imprisoned a long
time. Their missionary stations were broken up. Among
those captured was the venerable Father White, one of the
pioneer colonists. Uc was sent to JB^igland a prisoner and

was tried on a charge ot treason, but secured his acquittal.
On account of his aee and infirmity he was not permitted
by his ecclesiastical superiors to return to the province.
He died in England in 1656. Ingle returned to England
after this rebellion in Maryland, and was there prosecuted
by Captain Cornwaleys for his robberies.

While Maryland was experiencing these troubles from
without, ii was not by any means neglectful of its internal
economy. Its first Assembly met at St. Mary's, Feb-
ruary 26, 1635. Leonard Calvert was president of the
Assembly, and it was apparently composed of all the free-
men in the colony. It was evidently intended to be purely
democratic — an assembly of the whole people. Some sup-
pose the word ^freemen" mentioned in the writ of sum-
mons meant only those who held property. But a vote
of the Assembly of 1642 seems to prove that the term
^ freemen," in the first years of the colony at least, desig-
nated a citizen above the age of majority, and not held
to personal service." An instance is given of a Thomas
Weston, who, being called, stated that he was no freeman,
as he had no possessions and no certain dwelling place.
By a vote, however, it was decided that he was a freeman,
and as such was entitled to a vote. Men were allowed to
vote cither in person or by proxy.

This first Assembly drew up a body of laws and for-
warded it to the proprietary for his approval. It was re-
jected, probably on the ground that under the charter the
proprietary had the authority to make laws with the assent
of the freemen, not vife vnsa. This threw the province
back upon the common law of England during the two
years following. This body of laws, together with the
record of the proceedings of the Assembly, has not sur-
vived the ravages of time. On the other hand, we have the
record of the second Assembly, which met on Januar)' 25,
1638. It was made up, likewise, of all the freemen of the
colony. If not present in person, they were represented
by proxies. The governor presided and was joinfed by

coundllon appointed by the proprietaiy* The freemen weie
summoned in the usual way by writ, and tliose omkted could
present themselves at the meeting of the Assembly and
claim their seats. The usual Parliamentary privil^ of
freedom from arrest for minor crimes during the sessioias
of the Assembly was accorded the members.

The Assembly was now, in turn, given the opportunity
of returning in kind the proprietary's veto of their body of
laws of the first Assembly. A draft of laws he had sent
over was read, and rejected by a large majority. A serious
deadlock was threatened. The &lt;jnvernnr*s commission did
not give him the power of [&gt;iiiiislii[]i: r.i[)ital offences except
under the laws of the province. Some held that the laws
of £ngland would become operative, while others held
"that such enormous otfences could hardly be cumniitted
without mutiny, and then they might be punished bv iiuirttal
law." A case in point was awaiting iiccision. i homas
Smith, to whom vvc have referred as second in command
o( Claiborne's forces at the naval engagement on Pocomoke
River, had, in the meantime, been arrested for piracy and
murder. "There was no grand jury to indict him, no court
to tiy hkoy and no law to try him under/' The case was,
nevertheless, proceeded with in this manner: in the after-
noon of the 14th of March, 1638, the whole Assembly,
being impanelled as a grand jury, brought in the indict-
ment. Thereupon it resolved itself into a hi§^ court of
justice, and appointed Secretary L&gt;ewger as attoniey«&gt;general.
The prisoner, upon being arraigned, pleaded not guilty ; he
was, nevertheless, impartially tried and found guilty. The
governor pronounced the death sentence. This sentence
is interesting in that it shows the persistency of the old
legal forms. It is as follows:

"Thomas Smith, you have been indicted for felony and
piracy; to your indictment vou have pleaded not guilty;
and you have been tried by the freemen in this Cjeneral
A«;&lt;scmhlv, who have tound you guilty, and pronounce this
sentence upon you: that you shall be carried from hence



226 MUDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



to the place from whence you came, and thence to the
place of exccutioit) and ihall be there hanged by the neck
lUltn you be dead, and that all your huida» goods and chat-
telsy shall be forfeited to the lord proprietor^ saving that
your wife shall have her dower, and God have mercy
upon your soul."

It is recorded that the prisoner then demanded his clergy,
but the privilege was denied him, the governor holding that it
could not be allowed in his crime. Furthermore, that even
if it could be allowed it was then too late after judgment.

At the next session of the Assembly, the government
was remodelled. Writs of summons were displaced by
writs of election. Burgesses selected from ever) hundred
took the place of the popular assembly. The House of
Assembly was to iiKct triennially, and was made up of the
burgesses together \\ ith the governor and Council. More
frequent sessions could be held if specially suniaiuiied by
the governor, i he proprietary retained, however, the very
dangerous privilege of summoning members by special writ.
Such members had ec^ual privilege of voting with the regu-
larly elected burgesses. If summoned in suffictem numtat
they could) of coutk, annul the popuhur wilL However^
unfiur advantage does not seem to have been taken of this
provisbn. Another peculiar provision was retained: that
those freemen who had fiuled to vote for the bmgesses
elected migjbt appear in person and claim their seats. Some
of them availed themselves of the privilege. During this
session, four acts were passed of the character of a Bill of
Rights. Freedom of worship was secured, allegiance to the
king was affirmed, the liberties of Englishmen were assured
to the freemen, and the territorial ri^s of the proprietary
were confirmed. Next, civil and criminal courts were estabn
lishcd, provision was made for justices of the peace and other
officers, a code cf bu s was enacted, commerce and arrricul-
ture were regulatcil, and arranirements were made for the
meeting and inspection of the militia. For some reason or
other, these acts failed of passuig to a third reading, and it

was not until the next session chit the ^colony was equipped
with all the machineiy of a representative popular govern-
ment" (Biowne)*

In the meantime, the colbnj increased rapidly in popula-
tion. New colonists came in a steady stream and tooJc up
new manors, plantations, and homesteads. As soon as the
population of a district had increased sufficiently, it was
erected into a hundred. Such, for instance, was St. George's
Hundred, established in January, 1638^ and placed under
the command of a high constable. Many of the settlers
came as "servants" and paid for their passage by terms
of service of from three to hvc years. Most of them were
farmers and artisans, but not a few of them were men
of good families. At the expiration of their terms of ser-
vice, "servants" acquired all the rights and privileges of
freemen. In addition, many craftsmen crime out at their
own expense and received land aliuuiicnts larger than
those received by the others. It may be said, in general,
that the character of the majurity of these early settlers in
Maryland was much above the level of the average colonists
in America at this time. They were for the most part of
the kind most beneficial to a young and struggling colony.
Some came with their entire fiunuies, intending to settle
upon the land permanently. The younger men came with
the determination of making a place of responsibility for
themselves in the colony. The terms of colonization were
exceedingly liberaL No extraordinary ielig|k&gt;us or political
tests were required of anyone.

In 1649, ^ i*'^^^ settlement to St. Mary's was established
within the bounds of Baltimore's grant. The Congrega-
tional or Independent Church had been established in Vir-
ginia in 1642. Notwithstanding the laws made against the
members of this denomination, they increased in numbers
until they had about one hundred and eighteen members.
Thinking they were increasing too rapidiv, the Virginin
authorities broke up their conventicle and scattered their
membersiup. Their pastor, Mr. Harrison, went to Boston,

and tbdr cider, Mr. Duiuid, went to Maiyland. Soon
after the latter had lettted in Maiyland, some of the mem-
bers of the church followed him (1649). '^Wf established
themselves at a place the^ called Providencey but after-
ward changed to Anne Arundel. This was most probably
on or near the spot on which the city of Annapolis now
stands.

St, Maiy's, the first settlement in Maryland, had always
been the seat of government, but when Francis Nicholson
became governor (July, 1694), he ordered the Assembly to
meet at Anne Arundel town instead of St. Marv*s (Septem-
ber 21, 1694). In a suhsequmt chapter we shall show
bow the inhabitants were greatly excited over this change,
knowing as they did tliat it meant the ruin of their town.
We shall i\n(\ that they appealed to the Assembly in \ ain to
reconsider its action. The seat of government was changed
to "Anne Arundel town," and the Assembly held its first
session in the house of Major Dursey, February 28, 1694.
In the next session they gave the town tlic name of Annapolis
and made provision for the erection of public buildings and

The news of Governor Odvert's having lied to Vii]pnta
after the invasion of Chubome and Ing^ had proved sue*
cessful soon reached England. The proprietary. Lord Balti-
more, on learning the news, was in despair and seems to
have considered lus province as lost to him. He sent in-
structions to his brother to realise whatever he could fiom
the general wreck and ruin. But the governor, being on
the spot, did not consider all lost. Chubome and Ingje
were already proving themselves obnoxious to the colonists,
and then, again, the proprietary had a staunch supporter
in Sir William Berkeley, the royal Governor of Virginia.
Governor Calvert merely bided his time. The auspicious
moment arrived toward the latter part of the year 1646.
He raised a small force composed of Viri^inians and fugi-
tives from Maryland, pledging the proprietary's and his own
esutes to pay them. With this ridiculously small force he

retook St. Maiys without any resistance, and soon brought
back the whole Western Shore to its allegiance to the
proprietary. Kent Island offered some resistance, but it
likewise submitted after a while. A general amnesty was
proclaimed to all who had taken part in the insurrection,
on the sole condition that they take the oath of fidelity.
Ing^e and an associate, Durford, only were excepted.

Governor Leonard Calvert died in Maryland, June 9,
1647, and Thomas Greene succeeded him. Greene did not
prove a success, and in 1648 Baltimore removed him and ap-
pointed William Stone governor. Stone was a Protestant,
and it was probable that his appointment was dictated by a
desire on the part of the proprietary to remove a source of
discontent. Maryland was represented as being a strong-
hold of Popcrv in which Protestants were persecuted and op-
pressed. The new governor was bound by his oath of office
to protect every person of every faith in the free exercise
of his rehgious views. Finally, the very next year, 1649,
the famous Act of Toleration was passed. It was entitled
"An Act Concerning Religion." It laid fines upon those
who spoke lightly of the Virgin Mary, Apostles, and Evan-
gelists, while the penalty of death was to be exacted of those
who blasphemed any Person of the Holy Trinity. Those
who reviled another on account of his religious persuasion
by calling him Puritan, Jesuit, Papist, and the like, were to
be punished. Swearing, drunkenness, disorderly recreation,
unnecessary work on the Sabbath, were forbidden. The
clauses of die act guaranteeing liberty of conscience are well
worth quoting: whereas the enforcing of the conscience
in matters of religion hath frequently fallen out to be of
dangerous consequences — *^and the better to preserve
mutual love and amity among the inhabitants of the Prov-
ince;" it was provided that no person believing in Jesus
Christ should be in any ways "troubled, molested, or dis-
countenanced for or in respect of his or her religion, nor in
the free exercise thereof." Heavy penalties were provided
for infractions of this last provision of the act.

The execution of Charles I. in 1649 P^^ccd the future
of the province very much in doubt. Baltimore did not
oppose the new order oi things, and seemed to be on good
terms with Parliament and the English leaders. This is
evidenced by the fact that Charles II. in 1650, while a fugi-
tive in the island of Jersey, dechitd Baltimoce a febel and
gave the govemment of Maiyland to Sir William Davenant,
the English poet and dianutist. It is said that he actually
set sail for America, but was captured in the English Channel
and sent back by a Parliamentaiy cruiser. Virginia had pro-
claimed Charles II. king, and had enacted the death penalty
for anyone who should dispute his title. This act brought
a fleet from Parliament to reduce the colony to subjection.
Ingle, who was then in England, tried to involve Maryland
in the hostilities at the same time, but Baltimore proved to
the satisfaction of the ParJiamentar)"^ government that there
was no revolt in that colony against the new order of things.
His representations were successful, and Maryland was
stricken out of the instructions issued to the Parliamentary
Commissioners, to whom was intrusted the duty of reducing
to subjection the recalcitrant colonies. Nevertheless, prob-
ably through the machinations of William Claiborne and
Richard Bennett, the expression the phntations within the
Chesapeake Bay*' was finally inserted in the commission
dated September 26, 1651. After the subjection of Vir-
ginia, the Parliamentaiy Commissioners turned their atten-
tion to Maryland. At first they deposed Stone, but afterward
reinstated him. Then th^ took action that practically
abolished the rights of the proprietary. Baltimore sought
redress, but was unsuccessful for the time being.

Cromwell having expelled the Rump Parliament, April
?o, 1653, ^""^ having declared himself Protector, Stone
proclaimed him such in Maryland. That province was,
however, a proprietary government by virtue of its charter,
but was now held under the Protectorate. Cromwell did
not object to this, but Claiborne and Bennett, for reasons
of their own, gathered together a force composed partly

of Maiyluiden and partly of Virg^iianS) and compelling
Stone to reiigpi appointed a Providence Puritan, Captain
William Fuller, in hit place. Writs were now iitiicd by
the CommiflMoners, of whom Claiborne and Bennett were
two, wliidi were religiously intolerant. No Roman Catholic
was allowed to vote or to be elected as a burgess. They
repealed the Toieiadon Act of 1 649, and enacted in its stead
one of their own making, which they called ^ An Act Con-
cerning Religion." By its provisions, none who professed
Roman Catholicism might receive protection. Moreover,
those who professed a belief in ihat religion were not to be
permitted to worship accordmg to its forms. No Protes-
tants professing faith in Christ were to be interfered with,

provided that this liberty was not extended to popery or
prelacy, or to such as under the protl ssiofi uf Christ hold
forth and practise licentiousness." Roman Catholics and
the Churchmen, together with the lirou nists, Quakers, Ana-
baptists, and some other Protestant sects, were deprived of
the freedom of worship which they had previously enjoyed
to a greater or lesser degree. Surely," says Browne, this
toleration m^it have been cxprened in briefer phrase***

Lord Bahsmore'i territorial rigjbts were next attacked.
'The whole province was thrown open to aU who desired to
take up land, without any reference to the proprietary or his
representatives. Baltimore complained to Cromwell, who
directed Bennett to desist from interfering with the Mary-
landers. But, prior to this, Baltimore had rebuked Stone for
so promptly complying with the request to resign. Stone,
smarting under this rebuke, collected a force and advanced
upon Providence. Fuller, in command of the Puritans,
.met him with a force of one hundred and seventy-five men,
supported by two ships in the river. The captains, being
Puritans, naturally consented to help Fuller. A battle was

otben were condemned to death, but through the interces-
gionfl of the toldien and some of the women their lira
were tptred. Stone, though severely wounded, was kept
in confinement for some time. The Puritans seised the
great seal and the records and confiscated the propeitjr of
the conquered force.

The whole question of the rights of Baltimore was again
referred to the Protector and the Commissioners for Planta-
tions, and a decision was once more rendered in the pro-
prietary's favor. He now, in turn, lodged a complaint
against Bennett and Claiborne for the massacre at Prov^
dience* Baltimore was fully sustained in all his rights,
sovereign and territorial, and his authority throughout the
province was reestablished. The Toleration Act of 1649
was reenacted and this time was made perpetual. The
agreement was signed and sealed on March 24, 1658. A
general pardon was cm n ted to all those who had supported
the insurrection, and for the oath of fitlelity was substituted
mcrc1\' an obhgation to be loyal to the government of the
proprietary. This obligation read as follows: "I, A. R.,
do promise and engage to submit to the aurharity of the
right honourable Cecilius Lord Baltimore and his heirs,
within this province of Maryland, according to his patent
of the said province, and to his present lieutcn;iiU and other
officers here by his lordship appointed, to whom I will be
aiding and assisting, and will not obey or assist any here in
opposition to them." Those wlio did not care to take the
obligation upon themselves were acc&lt;iidcd the privilege of
leaving the province within a year. All cabcs 111 dispute
were referred to the Lord Protector and the Council. No
one was to rest under a disability of any kind for taking part
in the recent troubles. The turbulent Claiborne, from this
time, drops out of the history of Maryland.

Prior to this final happy adjustment of the dispute, Captain
Josiah Kendall had been appointed Governor of Maryland by
Lord Baltimore. Philip Calvert, Lord Baltimore's brother,
was appointed secretary of the province, and instructions

LORD BALTIMORE'S EXFERIMMNT



were issued to the new governor. Fendall had not been
long in office before he began scheming to enlarge his
authority at the expense of that of the proprietary. He early
set forth the claim that he held his authority solely from the
Assembly itself. Through his influence the Assembly was
reorganized, all former acts were repealed, and it was made
a felony to change the government thus created. Fendall
practically renounced his allegiance to the proprietaiy and
surrendered his comnussion. A new one was issued him
by the Assembly. Thus, by a few aibitraiy acts, the whole
constitution of the province was changed and the proprie-
tary's entire authority taken from him.

As soon as Baltimore learned of FendalPs treachery, he
appointed (1659) brother, Philip Calvert, illegitimate
son of Sir George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, gov-
ernor in Kendall's stead. An order from the king was
secured, directing Sir William Berkeley, the royal Governor
of Virginia, to assist in reestablishing the proprietary govern-
ment. 71u)se who had been unwittingly dra wn into the
plot were to be pardoned. Fendall and Fuller, however,
were on no account to be spared. As soon as Philip Cal-
vert's commission was shown, the rebellion collapsed com-
pletely. Fendall tried to make trouble for Bakimore by
stirring up a rebellion in Charles Cuuiuy, but failed misera-
bly. Afterward he and other leaders in the plot surrendered
themselves. They were found guilty of treason and sen-
tenced to banishment and forfeiture of their estates* Later,
upon Fendall's pleading abjectly for pardon his sentence was
considerably mitigated.

The le^slative machinery as now constituted consisted
of the governor and Cduncil sitting as an U|)pi r House and
the delegates sitting as a Lower House. This bicameral
form of government had been introduced in 1650 at a ses-
sion of the Assembly, which enacted "that the present
Assembly, during the continuance thereof, be held by way
of upper and lower house, to sit in two distinct houses,
apart, for the more convenient dispatch of business therein



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



to be consulted of." The assent of both Houses was neces-
sary to the passage of a bill. The Upper House, being
appointed by the proprietary, represented his interests. The
Lower House, elected by the people, in turn represented
their interests. Although the establishment of this bicamend
form of government granted the people a great increase of
popular privileges, yet the proprietary not only confirmed it
but forbade its change. Later, he g^ve the freemen the
additional privilege of initiating laws subject to his veto,
whereas his charter conferred upon him the privilege of
initiating laws subject to their adoption by the Assembly.
However, the governor and Council continued to exercise
the charter privilege, under certain restrictions, of enacting
ordinances having the force of law. The Council, likewise,
transacted executive business. The government as thus
established continued without material change until the
Revolution.

Besides that with Virginia, two other boundary disputes
engaged the proprietary's attention prior to the deposition
of James 11. The first was with the Dutch and the Swedes
on Delaware Rivcr and Bay, and came very early in the
historv of the province. The second was with William
Penn, and came upon the eve of the second English Revo-
lution. Both these disputes are of considerable impor-
tance, inasmuch as they were carried on with considerable
acerbity by all the parties interested. These disputes, like-
wise, fill many pages of the history of the colonies engag^
in them. After thie English conquest of New Netherland
and after the territories on the Delaware had become a part
of Pennsylvania, both disputes were merged into the one
with William Penn. A brief survey of these disputes will
not, consequently, be out of place at this point.

In 1638, as we have seen, the Swedes made their first
permanent settlement within what was then claimed to be
the limits of Maryland. From that time, however, they
continued to make settlements on the west bank of Dela-
ware River without hindrance from the Maryland authorities.

LOltD BALflMORE'S EXPERIMEHT



Nor were they in any manner serioualy diattnbed until 1655,
when they were subdued by the Dutch. The Dutch^ like-
wise, had made aettlements along the Delaware, but they had
died out one by one until the tragic massacre of the inhabit-
ants of Zwaanendal by the Indians in 1631. Nevertheless,
other Dutch attempts at colonization followed.

While the Dutch and the Swedes were squabbling over
this section, the Maryland authorities warned both that they
were trespassing on Baltimore's territory. The further de-
mand was made that they should acknowledge his authority,
quit the province, or take the consequences, which, it was
intimated, would be serious. Stuyvesant thereupon sent
Augustine Herman and Resolved Waldron to discuss the
affair with the Maryland iiithoritics. Nothimx, however,
came ot the conference, for neither [lartv wns willing to con-
cede anything. Manifestoes were exchanged, after which
the envoys departed, Waldron to report to Stuyvesant, and
Herman to take up a permanent residence in Maryland
under a manorial grant from Lord Baltimore.

So important a personage was Augustine Herman in the
attairs of New Netherland and Maryland, and so important
a service did he rciidcf the latter province in particular, that
it will not be out of place to pause in our narrative long
enough to record the principal events in his interesting
career. Born in the city of Prague, Bohemia, about 1608,
he had played the roles of" soldier, scholar, artist, merchant,
land-surveyor, speculator, and manorial proprietor" before
his death in 1686. Having served through several cam*
paigns in the army of Count Albert von WaUenstein, be
was present, in all probability, at the battle of Lutzen, when
that general was defeated by the Swedes and Gustavus
Adolphus was killed.

Probably as early as 1633, Herman emignited to New
Amsterdam, where for several years he represented the firm
of Gabry and Sons, merchants of Amsterdam, He soon
became promment in the aiiairs of New Netherland, for,
shortly after his arrival, we lind him despatched to the

Dutch fettkmentt on South River in the interests of •one
land purchase venture. As a result of an unfortunate in-
vestment in a small privateer called Lm Garcf^ he experienced
financial reverses in 1651. Two yean later, however, he
made a satisfiictofy settlement with his credhois. He op-
posed the policy of the Dutch West India Company, and,
as one of the Nine Men, supported Adrian van der Donck's
**Remonstruice" to the States General. Later, he wu
arrested by Stuyvesant on a trivial charge, but was soon
dischai^ged from custody. As a result of a trick played by
George Baxter, he and a companion were arrested in 1652
for conspiring against the Rhode Island government. They
had consiclerahle difficulty in establishing their innocence.

By 1659, Herman seems to have made bis peace with
Stuyvesant, for it was then that he and Resolved Waldron
were sent as a commission to Maryland. They were to
reach some agreement with Governor Fendall by which the
boundaries between the Maryland and the New Netherland
possessions on South River might be permanently estab-
lished. No doubt Herman owed his appointment to his
knowledge of surveying, his linguistic attainments, and
his business ahilirv.

Fortunate) Merman kept a journal of this expedition to
Maryland (A'nv y'ork Colottial Docufnent^^ ii). Accompanied
by soldiers and guides, the two commissioners made their
way on fool and by canoe to Patuxent, where they spent
several days in conference with Governor Fendall and
I^hilip Calvert. From Patuxent they sailed down Chesa-
peake Bay and secured an interview with the Governor of
Virginia. Later, they returned to Maryland, and it was
then that IK [man uiFcred to make a survey and draw a
nui[) of' tlu' w hole province in considt rntion of a manorial
grant. Luid liakiniure accepted the terms of the offer.
Herman spent about ten years on this survey, and received
a grant of about five thousand acres of land in recognition
of his valuable services. It was situated on Elk River, and
for the most part was in the present Cecil County. From

time to time, he increased his holdings to between twenty
and thirty thousand acfcs. The original grant he named
** Manor of Nova Bohemia," About 1662 lie removed his
hoyaefaoU ftotn New Amttendanif and on the 19th of June
of the same year he received hb fint patent from the
proprictaiy.

Herman's huge map of Nfaiyhmd, with a medallion por-
trait of himaelf, was publiihed by Faithome in London
about 1670* A copy of it is preserved in the British
Museum, and it is highly commended by contemporaries.
A lepresentatioo of the Alleg^uuiy Mountains, near die
present city of Cumberland, Maryknd, appears in one comer
of the map. A note in explanation of the illustration gives
us a very good idea of the crude conception of the geo-
graphical extent of the North American continent prevailing
at that time. These mighty high and great Mountaines

be the very middle Kidg of Northern America and the

Herman erected his manor house on a stream which he
called Bohemia River, near the head of Chesapeake Bay.
Here he lived in great style and was the most important
personage in that part of the col(&gt;nv for nearly a quarter of
a centur}'. The following inscription appears on a stone
on his manor:

^Augustine Herman, Bohemian,
The First Founder U
Seater of Bohemian Manor
Anno 1661."

The old Bohemia Manor House was burned in 1815.
Many valuable historical documents and mementos were
destroyed.

In the nicaiuime, the relations between Maryland and the
Dutch on the Delaware became so strained that, in 1659,

Lord Baltimore contemplated reaortiog to force. He soon
found, however, that he could expect no aid from Virginia or
New England. Nor had it, in hct^ been definitely decided
whether or not New Amstel was within the fortieth parallel.
Until that question should be definitely determined, Baltimore
decided it would not be well tt&gt; be too hasty. Hostilities
were consequently very wisely deferred.

In 1663, (jovernor Charles Calvert, eldest son of the
second Lord Baltimore, Cecilius Calvert, who had in 1661
succeeded Philip Calvert, visited the Dutch authorities at
New Amsterdam and tried to arrange a settlement of tlie
boundary question, but was not successful. In 1664, ^ii%
Chailet settled the matter-^ur ladier unaetded it — by gat-
ing hu brother James, the Duke of York, aU the teiritoiy
extending from the west bank of the Connecticut to the
eastern 2iore of the Delaware. As we have seen, James
sent a military force to take possession of his grant, but it
was some time before the whole Dutch power was finally
overthrown and himself firmly established in its possession.

In 1682 William Penn and Charles Calvert, now the
third Lord Baltimore, had a conference to discuss the dis-
pute which had arisen concerning the boundary between
their respective grants. Penn exhibited his patent dated
1681, and Baltimore produced his c harter antedating Pcnu's
grant by half a century. Baltimore clainu d as his northern
boundary the fortieth parallel, " which," said he to Penn,
**by your patent, is your southern bounds, as Watkiii's
Point is mine." Penn, while acknowledging this, tried to
persuade Baltimore to agree upon thirty-nine degrees five
minutes as his northern boundary. Baltimore, of course,
refused to agree to this. Another meeting was held at
New Castle, May, 1683, but with no better results. Fear-
ing the consequences of Penn's representations to the king,
Baltimore left for England to present his case in person.
He had little reason to believe that he would receive con&lt;-
sideration, for James who had succeeded his brother as
king in 1685, was endeavoring by every means possible to

concentrate in himself not only all the power in England
but likewise in the colonics.

After repeated requests on the part of Penn, the English
Privy Council, November 7, 1685, decided a part of the
boundar)" disputes. I'he pcnmsula was to be divided be-
tween Haiti more and Penn by a meridian line running north
from the latitude ot Cape Hcnlopen. With this decision,
Charles Calvert, who had succeeded Cecilius to the title and
possessions in 1675, was very much disappointed* Inas-
much as James 11. was a Roman Catholic, Bsdtimore thought
his proprietary interests would not suffer. Such was not the
case, for James r^arded his colonial possessions merely as
fruitful objects of exploitation. Consequently, he promoted
the interests of Lord Baltimore only to the extent that they
were not antagonistic to his own. In 1691 William III.
assumed the government of the province, but the proprietafy
was, however, allowed to retain the income from his pro-
vincial possessions. In 1741 his heirs were restored ^to
all their rights as fully as the legislature thought fit that any
proprietor should enjoy them."




CHAPTER X



EVOLUriON OF mw JERSEr, J614-168S

The early history of the territory now comprised within
the bounds of the present State of New Jersey is inextrica-
bly bound up with that of New Netherland and, after the
English conquest, with that of New York. First settled

the Dutch bodi on North River and on South River,
this territory was nevertheless embraced within the patent
of the Council for New England (1620) — ^the successor to
the Plymouth Company. Though settled and still claimed
by the Dutch, and though a part of the patent of the Coun-
cil for New Eng^nd, the territory was nevertheless included
within the very indefinite Palatine grant of New Albion
(1634). The very next year (1635) it was again assigned
to Lord Mulgrave on the dissolution of the Council for
New England. Not until June, 1664, ^ ^&gt;ct, was even
the semblance of an independent existence conferred upon
it. On June 23d and 24th of that year, even before the
actual conquest of New Netherland, the Duke of York
executed deeds of lease and release to Lord John Berkeley
of Stratton and Sir George Carteret, n;rantinf?; them the terri-
tory now comprised practically within the limits of New
Jersey. E\ en then, from time to time, it was claimed by
the governors of New York either to be subsidiary to the
latter province or actually a part of it. The attitude assumed
by Governor Sir Edmund Andros, of New York, in 1680
toward Captain Philip Carteret, Governor of New Jersey,

241

MIDDLE arATEH /iND MARYLAND



and the practical annexation of New Jersey to New York
in 170a, during the reign of Queen Anne and the governors-
ship of Viscount Combuiyf are cases in point*

An attempt had been nude by the Dutch in 16 14 to form

a settlement on the present site of Jersey City^ and some
fortifications against the Indians had been constructed. But

it was not until after the establishment of a settlement by
the Dutch at New Amsterdam that plantations were Started

in earnest on the western side of the bay. Bergen was begun
about 161 7, hwi it WAS a mere trading place for the Indians
during its hrst years, l^or mutual protection against the
Indians the farmhouses were huih in close proximity, while
the farm lands lay in the surrounding districts. This group
of farmhouses formed the village of Bergen. Smith (^History
of Nciv Jersey^ 61), thinks a few Norwegians and Danes
may iiavc been concciiJcU with the Dutch in the ou^mal
settlement, the name Bergen being derived from a city
in Norway. It is probabk, however, that the name was
not applied before 1660, and then it may have referred to
the high ground upon which the village was located. Or,
what is more probable, it may have b^n named for Beigen
in the north of Holland, because of the same affection for
home that led to the adoption of the names of other Holland
towns for the new settlements.

Settlements sprang up later in West Jersey than in East
Jersey. Colonists from New Haven were among the pio-
neer settlers of the former. Their object in this instance
was solely commercial. In fact, it might be said that the
inhabitants of this colony were always on the lookout for
new trading posts for the purpose of developing their trade
with the Indians. During the winter of 1638— 1639, George
LamlRittm, of New Haven, having carried on a hit lativc
fur trade wiih tlie Indians un Delaware iliver, reported that
fact to his fellow citizens of New Haven. They, likewise,
determined to secure a riiare of this trade now exclusively
enjoyed by the Dutch and the Swedes. A ^ Delaware Com-
pany '* was formed, consisting of the governor, the minister.

and all the priocipftl uihabitaiits of the colony. In 1640,
Captain Turner was sent to the Delaware in charge of a
vessel to spy out the land and to purchase lands along the
banks of Delawaie Bay from the Indians. He was specifi-
cally warned against interfering with the Dutch and the
Swedes. The spirit of these injunctions Turner disobeyed.
He purchased from the Indians nearly all the southwestern
part of Jersey and also a strip of land on the present site ot
Philadelphia. Nevertheless, the oificials o( New Haven, at
a town meeting, August 30, 164X9 approved the action of
the "Delaware Company."

The first instalment of settle ts sent to this terniury con-
sisted of fifty farniJics. Most oi these famihes settled on
Vaj kin's Kill, near the present site of Salem, New Jersey.
'1 he SwcJcs and the Dutch protested most vehemently
against these so-called "squatters." We have already re-
corded in a preceding chapter in consideiaUe detail bow
the settlements were broken up by the open hostility of the
Dutch and the Swedes on the Delaware* Many of die colo*
nists letumed to their New Engbnd homes during the winter
of 1643 ^ the spring succeeding. This &amp;ilure crippled
New Haven financially, but its inhabitants for a long time
continued to claim the lands they had purchased on the
Debware. Another attempt to settle these lands was made
in 1 65 1, but Peter Stuyvesant, then Director-general of
New Netherlands blocked it. The Dutch conquest of New
Sweden practically put an end to the immediate attempts of
New Haven to colonize the Delaware.

In the meantime, Bergen, having grown to considerable
proportions, was incorporated in 1661. Ticlman van Vlecrk
was appointed sheriff, and a subaltern bench ot justice was
then established. The latter was composed of the sheriff
and two schepens, and was probably the hrst legal tribunal
established in New Jersey. Steps were taken that yeai also
for the erection of a sawmill. In 1662, a well was dug,
four hundred and seventeen guilders were subj&gt;cnl)cJ Luward
the erection of a church, and in 1 664 a blocic house was

ordered to be built. Soon afu r the incnrpomtion of the
town, palisaded forts were erected for the protection of its
inhabitants. Likewise, at this time, a Reformed Dutch
church was organized. This congregation worshipped for
tvvcntv years in a log scbrujlhuuse, but in 1682 a more sub-
stantial cdihcc was erected. This church is the oldest in

New jci;&gt;C-\'.

In 1664, John Bailcy, Daniel Denton, and Luke Watson,
of Jamaica, Long Island, purchased of certain Staten Island
Indian chieft a tnct of land, on a part of which Eliza-
beth now stands. Having petitioned Governor Ricbanl
Nicolls, of New York, a deed to these hnds was granted
to John Baker of New York, John Ogden of Northuipcon,
John Baiiey and Luke Watson and their associates. The
deed was dated at Fort James, New York, the 2d of Decem-
ber, and is commonly odled the «^ Elizabeth Town Patent.*'
This grant was made before the title of Lord John Berkeley
and Sir G corge Oarteret was known. The Indians received
for this Elizai&gt;ethtown tract: ^Twenty fathom of tnyden
Cloth, two made Cotes, two gunnes, two kettles, ten barres
of Lead, twenty handfulls of Powder, foure hundred fitthom
of white wampom, or two hundred fathom of black warn*
pom." The whole was valued at £7fi 14/. The grantors
were Mattano, Manamowaone, and Cowescomen, the deed
beiiT^ Ki[!;nr(i (inly hv Mnttano.

VVlK fi tlir Dulcc of "1 01k took possrssion of New Nether-
land and the surrounding ti rritory, he specified it by three
names, to comprehend all his titles. The province itself was
called "New York.** Long Island was called "Yorkshire."
1 he region between the Hudson and the Delaware was
called Aibuiiia." Little is kiinw n of this last territorial
division except of that portion ut it that was contiguous
to Manhattan. Albania offered the greatest attraction to
settlers, for it could be improved more readily than the other
colonies. There was plenty of fertile land; the rivers were
long and wide, and the seacoast was extensive $ and hopes
of rich mines were held.

EFOLUnolf OF NEW JERSEY



While Governor Nicolls was engaged in settling the
boundary dispute with Connecticut, the Duke of York was
taking steps to dismember the province of New York. To
Lord John Berkeley and to Sir George Carteret, even before
the conquest of New Netherland, the duke had given the
whole territory between North and South Rivers. Berkeley,
who was a brother of Sir William Berkeley, Governor of
Virginia, had been the duke's own governor and was after-
ward made treasurer of his household. He is described as
a "bold and msolent man, popishly inclined, not incorrupt,
and very arbitrary." Caitcrct, who was treasurer of the
Admiralty Board, had been governor of the island of Jersey
at the Restoration, and was made chamberlain of the king's
household. As Governor of Jersey he had received Charles
while Prince of Wales, and had defended the island against
Cromwell's forces, and had been the last commander on
British soil to honor the king's flag. He is described as the
^ most passionate man in the world."

To these 6ivorites, then, the Duke of York, on the 23d
and 24th of June, 1664, had granted aU that valuable ter-
ritoiy now practically coincident with New Jersey. The
territory was called " Nova Csesarea,** or New Jersey, in
commemoration of Carteret's defence of the island of Jersey
in 1649. Toward the end of July, 1665, Captain Philip
Carteret arrived at New York with about thirty emigrants
in the ship Philip, He was the cousin of Sir George, and
had been commissioned as governor of the new province.
Early in August he landed in New Jersey at the head of his
followers, carrvin?i; a hoe on his =;honlder and therein inti-
mating his intentions of becoming a planter with them."
He established himself on the north bank of "the Kills,"
and named the settlement Llizabethtown, after Elizabeth,
the wife of Sir George Carteret.

The grant of Nova Cjcsarca to Bcri^elcy and Carteret
is said to have been given in consideration of a "competent
sum of money.** By its terms, the errant included all that
" tract of land adjacent to New England and lying and




24.6 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



being to the westward of Long Island and Manhattan
Island ; and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and
part by Hudson's river; and hath upon the west, Delaware
bay or river; and extendeth southward to the main ocean as
far as Cape May, at the mouth of Delaware bay; and to
the northward as far a*? the northernmost branch of the said
bay or river of Delaware; which is in forty-one degrees and
forty ipinutes of latitude, and crosseth over thence in a
straight line to Hudson's river, in forty-one degrees of lati-
tude; which said tract of land is hereafter to be called
Nova Caesarea or New Jersey, and also all rivers, mines,
minerals, woods, fishings, hawkings, huntings, and fowling^,
and all other royalties, profits, commodities, and heredita-
ments whatsoever to the said land and premises, belonging
or in any wise appertaining, with their and every of their
appurtenances in as full and ample manner as the same is
granted unto the said Duke of York by the before recited
letters patent.'' These letters patent, in addition to other
rights, had conferred on the Duke of York that most im-
portant one of government. The power of hearing and
determining appeals was reserved to the king. Chsdmers
says: relying on the greatness of his connection, the duke
seems to have been little solicitous to procure the royal
privileges conferred on the proprietors of Maryland and
Carolina, whose charters conferred almost unlimited author-
ity. And while as counts-palatine they exercised every act
of government in their own names, because they were in-
vested with the ample powers possessed by the pnetors of
the Roman provinces, he ruled his territory in the name
of the king."

On February lo, 1665, Hcrkeley and Carteret published
The Concessions and Agreements of the Lords Proprietors of the
Province of Nova Ciesarca^ or Neiu "Jersey. The " Conces-
sions and Agreements'* were of the nature oi a constitu-
tion and were very liberal in their terms. Under them the
government of the province was placed in the hands of
a governor, a Council, and an Assembly. The Council was

EFOLUriON Of NEff JERSET



to be cbcMen by tbe cbief executive and was to be composed
of HOC lets tban six and of not more than twdve persons,
whik tbe Assembly was to consist of twdve persons who
were to be chosen annually by the freemen. The governor
and Council were given the power of appointing all officers
They were to execute the laws and were to exereiae a super-
vision over the courts appointed by the Assembly* All laws
not against the English statutes or against the proprietors
were to be passed by the Assembly. Such laws were to be
published by the governor and his CouncU. They were
to remain in force one year, during which time the Lords
Proprietors could take them up for consideration.

One hundred and fifty acres of land were given to eveiy
freeman coming over with the first c:&lt;^vernor, provided he
owned "a good mu'skct, borr twcUc bullets to the pound,
bandcliers and match convenient, and six months' provisions
for himself." Likewise, for every manservant or slave
brought over and similarly provided for, the freeman was
to receive an additional one hundred and fifty acres of land.
Slaves and Christian servants were to receive seventy-five
acres at the expiration uf their terms of service. Liberty
of conscience was guaranteed. In each parish, two hun-
dred acres were to be put aside for the ministers, who were
to be supported by the Assembly. These " ConcesKons/'
as they were called, were looked upon by the citizens of
New Jersey as a charter of their liberties and as of much
higher authority than the Acts of the Assembly.

When Governor Philip Ckrteret airived in New Jeney,
he fbiind four fiunilies who had settled round Elizabeth*
town under the Long Island patent. Their chum to the soil
hindered, at first, all harmonious cooperation with the gov-
ernor in his efforts for the progress of the new settlement.
Subsequently, however, the governor and Council, compro-
mising, came to an understanding with these claimants, by
which the local privileges granted them by Governor Nicolls
were confirmed. Carteret's treatment of the claims of these
settlers is but one of many evidences of his desire to induce



Digrtized by Google



248 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



settlers to lemain in the province and to persuade others to
Immigrate there. Very shortly after his arrival^ he sent men
to New England to induce settlers to come to New Jersey.
In this he was quite successful, for the invitation resulted
in bringing to Elizabethtown and the surrounding neighbor-
hood many new settlers. The ship that brought Carteret to
New Jersey returned to England to bring back more people
and goods. Several other vessels during the ensuing years
made trips for similar purposes. Within two years, thirty-
three inhabitants of Bergen, sixty-five of Elizabethtown,
thirteen from Woodbridge, twenty-four from Nayesink, two
from Middletown, and two from along the Delaware, sub-
scribed to the oath of allegiance.

Governor Carteret's offer of full civil and re!ip:?ons liberty
to all prospective colonists attracted the attentiDU of mem-
bers of Congregational Churches in Milford, (juilford, Bran-
ford, and New Haven. A committee, with Robert Treat
at itR head, was sent to Governor Carteret to confer with
him concerning the matter. Furthermore, they were in-
structed to examine carefully the lands offered them and
to decide for themselves from ac tual personal observation
whether or not it would be advisable to accept the offer.
They first examined the New Haven property on the Dela-
ware and decided upon the site of Burlington. Afterward,
however, from suggestions on the part of Governor Outeret,
they were induced to settle on Passaic River.

In May of 1666, the remnant of the old New Haven
colony of 1638, under the leadership of Robert Treat and
Matthew Gilbert, sailed up Passaic River. They' came with
their families, their beloved pastor, their church records
and communion service, their deacons and their household
goods." They settled at a place they at first called Milford,
from the home of Robert Treat. The name was soon

the Rev. Abraham Pierson, a minister at Bran ford in the
New Haven colony, whose flock migrated almost bodily
with him to New Jersey.

Before leaving Branford for their new home on the Pas-
saic, the emigrants adopted the ^ Fundamental Agreement *' :
**ist. That none shall he admitted freemen or free Bur*
gesses within our Town, upon Passaick River, in the prov-
ince of New Jersey, but such planters as are members of
some or other of the Congregational Churches; nor shall
any but such be chosen to Magistracy or to carry on any
part of Civil Judicature, or as deputies or assistants to have
power to Vote in establishing Laws and nuking or Repeal-
ing them, or to any Chief Military Trust or office. Nor
shall any But such church members have any Vote in any
such elections ; Tho' all others admitted to Be planters have
Right to their proper Inheritances, and do and shall enjoy
all other Civil Liberties and Privil^s, according to Laws,
Orders, Grants, which are or hereafter shall Be Made
for this Town. 2d. We shall with Care and Diligence pro-
vide for the maintenance of the purity of Religion in the
Congregational Churches.'* These articlf^s were suhscribed
by twenty-three heads of families. Some time after the colo-
nists h:iii been settled in Newark, the Fundamental Agree-
ment was slightly revised. The most important change in
the phraseology was that "the planters agree to submit to
such magistrates as shall be annually chosen by the Friends
from among themselves and to such Laws as we had in the
place whence we came." To this revision, sixty-four men
put their names — twenty-three were from Branford, and the
remainder from New Haven, Milford, and Guilford. That
illiteracy was not at all prevalent among these settlers is
very evident from the fact that out of the sixty-four signers
of the document only six were obliged to make their marks.

The New England settlers experienced some little trouble
with the Indians before they succeeded in settling peaceably
upon the lands granted them by Governor Carteret. They
hoped that Carteret would clear the lands of all claims
by the Indians; but this Carteret was not authorized to do.
The Indians objected to the first settlers taking up the
lands, and detained them on their vessels until satisfactory

understanding was leachcd. This objection arose mainly
from Robert Treat's failure to deliver a letter which Carteret
had written to the Indians. Finally, a satisfiKtory agreement
was made on board the vessel. The new settlers promised
to give the Indians fifty double hands of powder, one hun-
dred bars of lead, twenty axes, twenty coats, ten guns, twenty
pistols, ten kettles, ten swords, four bUuikets, four barrels of
beer, ten pairs of breeches, fifty knives, twenty hoes, eight
hundred and fifty fiithoms of wampum, twenty ankers of
liquors or something equivalent, and three troopers' coats."

In summing up the importance of this transplantation
of a New England colony to New Jersey soil, Levermore
(The Republic of New Haven^ 120) says most aptly: "It
seems to me that, after 1 666, the New Haven of Daven^
port and Eaton must* be looked for upon the banks, not of
the Quinnipiac, but of the Passaic. The men, the methods,
the laws, the officers, that mnde New Haven Town what it
was in 1 640, disappeared frcim the Connecticut Colony, but
came to full hfe again immediately in New Jersey. . . .
Newark was not so much the product as the continuation
ot New Haven.**

The first Assembly of New Jersey met at Elizabethtown
on May 26, 1668, and remained in session five days, 'i'here
were burgesses from Elizabethtown, Bergen, Woodbridgc,
Newark, Shrewsbury, and Middlctown. A bill of "pains
and penalties" was passed, resembling in many respects the
Levitical laws. A second meeting of the Assembly in
the following November considered the very vexed question
of the validity of land titles granted by Governor Nicolls.
As to his own grants, Carteret was always very careful to
see to it that the titles of lands were purchased, from the
Indians. Although the number of Indians in the neighbor-
hood was not large, yet they were sufficiently numerous to
cause considerable annoyance to the whites if they were so
inclined. The governor consequently ordered all newcomers
to purchase of the Indians, but if they had previously pur-
chased they jwere merely to pay their proper proportions.

EyOLUriON Of NEIV JERSET 251

This policy was undoubtedly a good one, for there was very
little trouble between the Indians and the whites in New
Jersey.

On the other hand, much trouble arose about the Mon-
mouth Patent, which included Middletown, Shrewsbury,
and other settlements. By Nicolls's grant, these settle-
ments had pow^r to pass such laws as they thought wise.
In pursuance of this privilege, they held a local Assem-
bly, June, 1667. They refused to recognize laws passed
at the first session of the General Assembly. Furthermore,
the deputies refused to swear fidelity and allegiance to the
New Jersey proprietors, and when commissioners tried to
collect assessments they met with a prompt refusal. The
settlements demanded exemption from any such claims,
citing their grants from Nicolls in support of this conten-
tion. At a meeting of the General Assembly, November,
1 67 1, Middletown and Shrewsbuiy were declared guilty of
contempt.

The trouble, unfortunately, did not stop here. On
May 14, 1672, the representatives of Bergen, Newark,
Woodhridn;e, Elizabcthtown, nnd Piscataway met to elect
a president. This meeting was not in accord with Philip
Carteret's wishes. The choice of president of this Assem-
bly fell on James Carteret, said to be an illegitimate son of
Sir George Carteret. He claimed to have a warrant from
his father. This meeting declared him not only president
of the Assembly but of the whole province. This was
open and declared rebellion. Governor Carteret then ac-
cepted his Couiicii's advice to depart for England, leaving
John Berry in charge. When the governor arrived in
England, he stated die condition of afiairs to the Lords
Proprietors. As a result, James Carteret was ordered imme-
diately to Carolina; and the New Jersey authorities were
required to recognize Nicolls*s grants to the insurgent set-
tlements. As a result of the publishing of these orders,
after Carteret's return in 1674 peace was soon established
throughout the province. In July, 1 674, Lord Berkeley was

induced to give up his giant in order that a more definite
boundary settlement might be established between his own
territory and that of Sir George Carteret. The deed of
division was executed on July i, 1676. From this time
tiU 1702, the two provinces of East and West Jersey were
separate and independent.

After the rcconquest of New Netherland by the Dutch in
167-^, Kli/abcthtown^Woodbridge, Newark, and Piscataway
surrendcix J to the New Amsterdam military tribunal. This
consisted of the commanders Cornelius Evertsen and Jacob
Binckes and Captains Anthony Colve, Boes, and Van Zyle.
The ownership of all lands by the English was legalized and
confirmed and placed on an equality with the right of owner-
ship enjoyed by the Dutch. Citizens conducting themselves
rightly weie to be exempt from bearing arms against Eng-
land. The laws of the Netherlands determining the descent
of property were to be enforced, yet the citizens might freely
dispose of their possessions. Liberty of conscience was not
to be interfered with. These terms were entirely satisfac-
tory to the people. Each town was directed to nominate,
by a plurality of votes, six persons for schepens, or magis-
trates. Likewise, two deputies for the purpose of nomi-
nating three persons for schouts and three for secretaries.
From the nominations thus made the Council selected three
magistrates for each town, and a schout and a secretaiy for
the six towns collectively.

The Dutch authorities somewhat doubted the loyalty of
the English, so they sent commissioners to visit the villages
of New Jersey and take the oath of each inhabitant. A
report was made to the authorities of all those who had
taken the oath and of those who had not. A code of laws
was promulgated on November i8th, considerably milder
than the drastic Levitical code of i668* It remained in
force only until the Treaty of Westminster, February 19,
1674, when New Netherhind was finally ceded to En^nd.
After that treaty New Jer^y once more passed into the
hands of the English.

Reference has been made to the decision of the crown
lawyers that the provinces belonging to the Duke ot York
before the Dutch Conquest reverted to the king after the
Treaty of Westminster. Charles TT., however, June 29,
1674, issued a new patent to his brother. Chalmers claims
that the Duke of York was really pleased with this decision,
because he got back New jcrsc\ , the loss of which was
deeply deplored by Governor Nicolls. The new patent
ignored the claims of Berkeley and Carteret. The latter
protested vigorously and sought the aid of Charles IL, with
whom he was a favorite. Sir George Canerct was com-
pletely successful, and in July, 1674, he received not only
his own former grant but the eastern part of New Jersey as
well. No notice was taken of the western part of the terri*
tory, which Berkeley had sold to some Quakers for ,000.
This caused some territorial entanglements which were not
unravelled until two years later by the Quintiparttte Deed."

When in October, 1674, Sir £dniund Andros assumed
the governorship of New York, he did not assert his full
authority over New Jersey. Nevertheless, be assumed an
overlordship over the province and gave William Dyer
power to collect the customs the duke had established
throughout his territory. We have seen that this led to a
serious clash between Andros and Carteret in 1676, which
was not settled until the New Jersey proprietor was finally
sustained in his independence by the king. The relations
between the two governors became more and more strained
until 1680, when Carteret was arrested, imprisoned, tried,
and acquitted, and then deposed from the governorship of his
province at the command of Andros. The Duke of York
repudiated Andros's brutal activity, and in 1680 relinquished
all claims to New Jersey. Andros's action in this matter is
generally accredited with being the major cause of his recall.

Let us now turn our attention for a moment to West
Jersey. Berkeley had sold his half-iiiterest to John Fen-
Witk on the i8th of March, 1673. The latter had been
a member of the Parliamentary army and had afterward

turned Quaker. In this purchase Fenwick. vsas abijociated
with Edward Byllinge, Hkewise a yuaker. These men
wished to establish an asylum in America where they could
worship with freedom from persecution. In the deed of
purchase, Fenwick was named trustee for Byllinge. Shortly
after, a land dispute arose between these two men, and
William Penn was called in as arbitrator. He awarded
nine-tenths of the purchase to Byllinge and one-tenth to
Fenwick, tog^her with a sum of money. Fenwick at first
refused to accept this settlement. Later, however, when
Byllinge became financially involved, Fenwick, as his trustee,
handed over the nine-tenths to William Penn, Gawaine
Laurie, and Nicholas Lucas. The transference of title
was signed February lo, 1674. Soon after, Fenwick's one-
tenth likewise passed under the control of these men. The
most prominent of these purchasers was William Penn.
Through his influence two land purchasing and colonizing
associations were formed. One of these consisted of York-
shire Friends and the nrher of London Friends. In 1677
commissioners were sent out to govern the prox ince.

In June, 1675, Fenwick sailed up the Delaware with his
children, relatives, settlers, and servants, and landed at the
mouth of a creek called by the Dutch Varkm's Kill, or "Hog's
Creek," near the Swedish settleiiifnt of Elsinburg. Fen-
wick named the place Salem, " peace." These high-handed
proceedings t o u sed the ire of Governor Andros, who de-
manded by what authority Fenwick settled there. Following
this up, the former had an order passed by the Council,
December 5, 1675, that Fenwick be not received as owner
of lands on the Delaware. Furthermore, Fenwick was
charged with granting land, and dispossessing owners of
their lands. Having refused to obey a peremptory order
to submit himself to the jurisdiction of New York, orders
were next issued for his arrest. Being brought a prisoner
to New York in December, 1676, a special court was sum-
moned the following month to try his case. He was com-
pelled to give a bond for £$00 not to act in a public capacity

and a similar bond to prosecute his case before the king.
Thereupon he was released and permitted to return to
Salem. Immediately upon his arrival he assumed all the
privileges of proprietorship, appointed officials, and iTuule
preparations for defence. Atiairs were conducted in this
manner until 1678, when Andios made some minor pro-
visions for a local government.

We have referred to the lirst boundar}^ settlement be-
tween East and West Jersey. The second was called the
**Quinti[^anite" from liic number of persons concerned ui it.
They were Sir George Carteret, William Penn, (lawaine
Laurie, Nicholas Lucas, and Edward Bvllinee. The pur-
pose of the conference was to readjust tin ImiHidary be-
tween East and West Jersey. It was felt ilut the previous
boundai) bciwccn the two provinces, a line running from
Barnegat to "a certain creek on Delaware River next
adjoining to and below" Rancocas Creek:, south of Bur-
lington, was too indefinite and veiy tmfair. The new
boyndary was to run from Little Egg Harbor to the forty-
fim degree of latitude on Hudson River. Thence it was
to extend in a straight line to the northernmost branch of
Dehware River. From that point it was to extend south-
ward to the most southerly line of Little Egg Haibor. The
^^Deed" was executed on July i, 1676, and was an attempt
to divide East and West Jersey into two equal parts. Later,
in 168 7, we find Keith trying to carry out this intention
of an equal division. He ran the line from Egg Harbor
northwardly to the south branch of Raritan River. Had
he extended the line to Delaware River as the ^^Deed"
called for. West Jersey would have contained about fifty-
four thousand acres leas than East Jersey.

When Sir George Carteret died, in 1680, he left his
I»operty in East Jersey to the Earl of Sandwich and others
in trust for the benefit of his creditors. The property was
sdd in 1680, but for some reason or other a transfer was
never made; so in 1681 the property was finally sold to the
hi^iest bidder. William Penn, with eleven associates, most

of whom had ali'c'»i&lt;Jy been interested in West Jersey, were
the purchasers, p&lt;^ying £-^y^QQ, Afterward, each of these
twelve men sold half of his interest to twelve others, making
twenty-four proprietors of the province.

Tftie crowning glory of the Quaker movement in Jersey
was that document of liberty known as Tbi Cmtisstmu and
AgreenuHU of tbt Piro^rieim^ FrubiUm^ and Inhalants tf
thi Prmnna rf lV$a Jtntf in Amtrica. This was fint
published on March 3, 1677. Penn is held to be the author
of this very democratic document. The people had com-
plete control of all local ailairB« while the proprietors had
but little power in the government. At first the people and
proprietors elected ten men as commissioners. Later, each
ten of the hundred electors selected a commissioner. The
Assembly was chosen veiy much in the same manner as
the commissioners. The people selected their own justices
and constables. Equal taxation and religious toleration were
among the rights guaranteed to the people. It was declared
that "No Men or number of Men upon Earth hath power
or Authority to rule over Men's consciences in religious
Matters." Before anyone could be deprived ot Life, Limb,
Liberty, Estate, Property, or any way hurt in his Privileges,
Freedom, or Franchises," he was tried by a jury consisting
of " 1 weive good and lawful Men of his Neighborhood/*
Perjury was punished severely, while in cases of murder and
treason the sentence was left to the General Assembly " to
determine as they in the Wisdom of the Lord shall judge
meet and expedient." One found guilty of bribing the
Assembly was ever afterward ineligible as a member of
the Genml Assembly. These *^ Concessions'* were read
before and after every session of the General Assembly and
to the people four times a year in every court in the prov*
ince. The document is probably the "first example of
Quaker legislation." The settlers on Fenwick's tenth'*
were not to enjoy the privileges of the code.

Mention has been made of the fact that the Quakers
organized two companies) one in Yorkshire and one in

London, having as their object the purchase of land in the
New World for settlement purposes. In 1677 the pro*
prietors sent commissioners to buy land from the natives,
and in the same year members of both companies, together
with others, sailed on the ship Kint from London. It is
said that Charles IL, while cruising for pleasure on the
Thames, came across them while they were on the point
of embarkation to America. On learning who they were
and what was their purpose, he gave them his blessing. The
expedition reached New Castle, August 16, 1677, ^'^^ P''^"
ceeded thence to Raccoon Creek, where a land in 2: was made.
There were in all two hundred and thirty persons. After
an exploration of the territory, the Yorkshire commissioners
chose the territory from the falls of the Delaware southward
as the scene of their future activities. The Lundon commis-
sioners selected what is nuw the site of Gloucester. The
former is known as the first or Yorkshire tenth,*' and the
latter as the second or London tenth."

When the Yorkshire commissioners found that the Lon-
don commissioners were going to settle so near them, they
proposed that the two combine and lay out a town for
mutual protection against the Indians. The Yorkshire
Company claimed* the larger share, as their land was the
best in the woods. The London Company, being few and
realizing they would be at the mercy of the Indians, reluc-
tantly agreed. A surveyor was employed to divide the site
on which they had determined to locate the town. A main
street was surveyed, on each side of which lots were laid
out. The Yorkshire Company took the easternmost lots,
while the other lots fell to the share of the London Com-
pany. At first the new town received the name of New
Beverly, but afterward it was called Bridlington, and still
later the name was changed to Burlington.

The proprietors of West Jersey appointed Edward Byl-
linge governor, who in turn appointed Samuel Jeniiino-s as
his deputy. Jennings arrived in September, 1681, lie was
an approved minister of the Quakers, and his experience,

candor, prohity, and ability rendered him useful to the whole
society of that people in the province. Although his temper
was hasty, he was always obliging and even atiectionate. In
spite of this, he was not always treated kindly and fairly.

The Assembly of May, 1683, decided that both the title
and government were purchased by William Penn and his
associates. Fearing that Byllingc might release Jennings
liuiii hii ulhce as deputy governor, the Assem!ilv appuijited
him governor. Jennings was j&gt;t'iit to Lngland lor the con-
firmation of his election and to consult with Byllingc.
Thomas Olive, speaker of the General Assembly, was
appointed deputy governor pro tern* This action of the
Assembly precipitated the Byllinge-Jennings dispute, which
was finally put in the hands of George Fox, Geoige White&lt;
head, and twelve other prominent Quakers to decide* A
decision was rendered in October, 1684* Bjrllinge was
declared to be the lawful governor and the power of the
General Assembly to choose a chief executive was dented.

Deputy Governor Jennings and the Assembly shortly
afterward agreed-upon «^ Certain Fundamental Principles"
of government. There were ten articles in all and they
breathed the spirit of democracy. 7'hey provided for annual
elections of the Assembly by the free people of the prov-
ince. The governor was g;iven the privilege of calling the
Assembly in extraordinary session if he deemed it necessary.
The governor was denied the power of raising military forces
or of making war unless ordered to do so by the Assembly.
He was likewise denied the power of making or enactmg
any laws whatsoever. Should he attempt to do so, he was
to be declared an enemy of the people. The Assembly
should not be prorogued without its own consent before
the expiration of a whole year from the day of election.
The consent of the Assembly was necessary before the
governor and council could levy 11 tax or raise any sum of
money whatever. All officers of State were to be nomi-
nated by the Assembly and were to be solely responsible
to that body. The governor could not make treaties, send

ambassadors, or enter into alliances without the Assembly's
consent. No tax or custom could be voted for a longer
time than for one whole year. There was to be freedom
of conscience and worship, and no one was to be debarred
from office by his religious belief.

A dispute that had arisen between the settlers of New
Jersey and the Governor of New York now reached a
critical stage. Very early in the history of the settlement,
the governor had levied a tax of ten per cent on imported
goods brought to Hoorn Kill. There was, in addition,
a tax on exports. When settlers began to arrive on the
Delaware they were charged five per cent on the invoice
value of their iroods and not on their net cost. 1'hc right
of the agents of the Duke of York to collect these duties
was questioned, and thruuiih ihcir friends in England the
colonists made a most \ i^n)rous protest. Chiefly through
the instrumentality of Wiliiani Penn, the Duke of York
finally consented to put the question in the hands of a com-
mission for decision. The commission ^ after considerable
time had elapsed, in turn referred it to Sir William Jones,
whose opinion was to be hnal. The vcrdicL was against
the duke, and in August, 1680, he declared West Jersey
free from the obnoxious duties. On the 6th of that month,
the duke furthermore granted to William Penn and others a
complete release of West Jersey.

Furthermore, two months later. East Jersey was released
and thus both the Jerseys became independent of New
York. Later, as we have seen, Penn and eleven associates
purchased the Carteret interests in East Jersey, and on the
14th of March, 1682, a new grant was made them, which
was fuller and more explicit than its predecessors. Finally,
on November 23, 1683, King Charles II. formally recog-
nized the proprietors' rig^it of soil and government. The
twenty-four proprietors formed a Council of Proprietors."
They were given power to appoint, oversee, and displace
all officers necessary for the management of their property.
Robert Barclay, a Scotch Quaker, was appointed governor.




26o MIDDLE StAtBS AND MARTUND



He was of unblemished character and had considerable influ-
ence with the king. Grahame says of him : " He was admired
by scholars and philosophers for die stretch of his learning and
the strength and subtility of his understanding, and endeared
to the members of his religious fraternity by the liveliness
of his zeal, the excellence of his character, and the ser-
vices which his pen had rendered to their cause." He was
allowed to exercise his authority through a deputy. He chose
Thomas Rudyard, a prominent lawyer of London.

Before the two Jerseys succeeded in shaking off their
dependence upon New York, and while West Jersey was
engaged in its disputes with the Duke of York, East Jersey
was at odds with its governor. PhiHp Carteret convened
the Assembly at Elizabeth in October, 1681. The governor
claimed the proprietor had the authority to alter the conces-
sions of 1665. The Assembly just as emphatically denied
the proprietor this authority and sent the governor and
Council the following communication: "It is the opinion
of this House that we are now about ours and the Countrv's
businesse. Everything is beautifull in season. This House
expects those Acts already before you should be passed and
returned back to this House." To this the governor and
Council made reply : True wisdome would teach you better
manners than to Stile Yorselves the Generall Assembly.
Doubtless there was no want of Ignorance and Disloyalty
where this Bratt had its educac'on insomuch as that the
generall assembly consists of the Governor Councell and
Deputies, ergo, the Deputies no generall assembly. It was
Lucifer's Pride that putt him upon settling himselfe where
God never intended to sett him and his Presumption pro-
duced or was forerunner of his fall. • • * Eveiything
being beautiful in its season and so we bid you farewell."
Thus was dissolved the last Assembly under the adminifr*
tration of Governor Carteret.

The death of Charles II. brought about very important
changes in both East and West Jersey. James II., upon
his accession, aimed at three things: first, the concentration

BFOLimoN OF mw ymtsBT 261



of his power in the Amcncan colonies ; secondly, the aboli-
tion of popular governments thirdly, the reductkm of the

colonies to absolute dependency. He issued qu9 warranto
proceedings in the courts to cancel the charters of East and
West jersey, as well as thtjse of other colonies. Sir
Edmund Andros was assigned the task of establishin;:^ a
centralized government. James was told his icvciuics might
be increased by strengthening his power over East and West
Jersey and other provinces. He set about doing ihis, regard-
less of the three charters he had granted while Duke of
York. The proprietors remonstrated. They petitioned
against the action of the Governor of New York in seizing
vessels trading to New Jersey, Th^ told the king that he
had not granted them New Jersey out of benevolence, but
that ;f 12,000 had been expended for it. As to not |wying
so much custom as New York, they replied that New Jersey
was a separate government — ^that New York laws were not
binding in New Jersey. But if the king desired, they would
put the du^ as high as it was in New York. And finally,
if the king wanted a change in government, they would let
him appoint one of their number as governor of both East
and We&lt;?t Jersey.

The only request the kmg granted them was the appomt-
ment of an officer at Perth Amboy to collect the customs.
This was, however, strictly in the line of his own interests.
No[hing could keep James from involving New Jerscv w ith
the other colonies, whose charters ajid constitutions he had
resolved to annul. This persistency led the proprietors of
East and West Jersey to offer to surrender their rights,
thinking that by so doing they might obtain from the king
a reconfirmation of this grant. Gawaine Laurie had been
appointed Deputy Governor of East Jersey in 1686, but he
was shortly succeeded by Lord Neil CampbeU. The latter
did not remain long in the province, but appointed Andrew
Hamilton as his substitute.

In April, 1688, during Hamilton's administrarion, the
proprieton surrendered their rights to James II. East and

West Jersey were annexed to Governor Andros's dominion
and Francis Nicholson was appointed lieutenant-governor.
Andros created considerable surprise bj retaining all the
officials in office* The change in government was thus
only nominal, the actual administration of affairs being con-
fided to the governor's lieutenant. Andros's control over
the y»Tscvs, however, was not long, for James II. was
compeJied to Hce from England and William of Oran|^

CHAPTER XI



PENN'S **HOLr EXPERIMEHT,'' i68r-i68s

It may be significant that at the height of Cromweirs

power Quakerism first made its appearance. It was the
most extreme form of Protestantism of the day, and Crom-
well was a most liberal-minded statesman in treatment
of religious sects. It was he, for example, who hrst en-
couraged the Jews to return to England after a practical
banishment of three hundred and fifty years; and it was
he who encouraged an enlargement of their political privi-
leges in at least one of the colonies. This large-minded
tolerance can be best appreciated when we understand to
what extent the attitude of the Quakers in social and polit-
ical matters freijucntly bubjected them to punishment. There
were many who refused to pay tithes, or to testify under
oath, or to lift their hats in the presence of a magistrate.
Their lack of ecclesiastical organization frequently led to
their being confounded with fanatical enthusiasts. Many
of them courted persecution by reason of their missionary
zeal, and their unfortunate confusion with the fanatics in-
stilled in the minds of the people a feeling of horror at the
spread of their doctrines. Nevertheless, Cromwell was not
disposed to annoy them, and, as a matter of fact, he counted
a number of prominent Quakers among his friends.

One of the most notabh conversions to Quakerism after
the Restoration was that of William Penn. He was horn in
London, October 14, 1644. His father. Sir Wilham Penn,

263



264 MIDDLE STjrSS AND MAKYUHD



had been ft vke-admiral of Cromwdl's fleet, but, having
made his peace with Chftries II., he wis knighted and con-
tinued in the enjoyment of his former bonon. Sir Wil-
liam had lent the king a considenble Mim of moaqr, wUck
Inr 1681, with accumulated inlciest, amounted to about
£lh'fiOO^ and as the exchequer was always low this obl^iH
tjon was not CftnceUed until long after. Even then it was
not settled in money, but by the transfer of a large tract of
land in America to his son. Young William received his
early education at Chigwell and under a private tutor on
Tower Hill. At sixteen he was sent to Christ Church,
Oxfoni, :uu1 while an undergraduate there showed a decided
leaning toward the Puritans. After hearing Thomas Loe
preach, he was greatly mfluenced by the teachings of the
C^iakers, and it was at Oxford that be and other students
became converted to the dtxinju s of that sect. His father
had high ambitions for his son and was exceedingly alarmed
at his religious tendencies, consequently in 1 661 he was
taken away from Oxford — or, as some claim, "sent down**
— and placed with some fashionable friends at Paris in the
hope of diverting his mind. This plan seemed for a while
to prove successful; iur after studying hard at a Huguenot
college in Saumur for a year or more, and after travelling a
year in Italy, Penn returned to England, a man of the world.
. Again, however, he heard Loe preach, and this time he
made a final decision to throw aside his worldly prospects,
disappoint his father, and cast his lot with the Quaken.

After studying law at Lincoki's Inn, he happened to visit
Irebnd, and at Cork was imprisoned for attending a Quaker
meeting. This was by no means the first time he under-
went imprisonment for his religiotis views, but the influence
of his father usually secured his release. Sir William would
have forgiven his son almost an3^ing, even his objection-
able manner of speech, but he could not brook young
Penn's refusal to lift hb hat not only to himself but to the
Duke of York or even to the king.' This was quite too
much for the old gentleman's endurance, and he turned

hb son out of doors. Afterward father and son became
reconciled through the entreaties of Lady Penn and the
representations of influential friends who admired in the
young man his lofty character and his dauntless courage.
Sir William died in 1670.

Penn's accession to the Quakers was a great help to that
sect. He was well bom, well educated, eloquent, and pos-
sessed of a considerable fortune. He did much to differ-
entiate the sect from the fanatical rabble with which it had
been unjustly confused, and in other ways he used all his
inftu("nce to better the condition of the Kriends. He often
pleaded with the Icing and judges to release them from prison,
and at times was successful, but, as a rule, the persecution
was as vigorous as ever.

Penn had often thought of estabhshing a colony for the
Quakers in America, and it was with this end in view that
he had obtained a part of the New Jersey grant. Friends
(locked to this colony in large numbers, and so successful
did the venture prove that Penn thought even more seriously
than ever of establishing an asylum of his own in the New
Worid. The government, which owed his father 16,000,
failing to satisfy the debt, Penn proposed that he be granted
a province in America by way of settlement. This propo-
sition was accepted and the terms of the charter were drawn
up and signed by the king on March 4, 1681.

Penn dius became proprietor of a large domain. He
drew up the charter himself in imitation of that of Mary-
land, although in at least two very important respects it
differed from it. Unlike the Maryland charter, this did not
grant exemption from crown or Parliamentary taxation.
Also, laws enacted by the Pennsylvania legislative body
were required to be sent to EngUmd for the royal approval,
while those of Maryland when confirmed by the proprietor
were not subject to this revision. The eastern bmindan- of
Penn*s province was the Delaware. The line began twelve
miles north of New Castle and, extending northward to the
forty-third degree of latitude, ran westward hve degrees.

The southern boundaiy was partly an arc of a circle having
a ladius of twelve miles north of New Castle and with that
town as its centre. At the supposed intersection of this arc
and the fortieth degree of north latitude, the line was to run
thence by a straight line westward to the limits of the longi-
tude mentioned as the western end of the northern boundary.
By a provision of the charter, Penn was to pay to the king
two beaver skins, which were to be delivered at Windsor
Castle oil the first day of January in every year. This
tribute was paid by the Penns until 1780. In order to have
an entrance to the Delaware, Pcnn bought of the Duke of
York that strip of territory afterward known as the "Lower
Counties," comprising New Castle, Kent, and Sussex of
what is now the State of Delaware. In all, the duke made
three conveyances in August, 1682. He released all his
rights to the province by the first; the town of New Castle
and the land iying within a twelve-mile circuit of the court-
house were granted by the second i and the land beginning
twelve miles south of New Castle and extending southward
to Cape Henlopen was &lt;rranted by the third conveyance.
Profiting by the trouble experienced with the New England
colonies, especial care was taken with Penn's charter to
define the proprietor's powers and to preserve the supremacy
of the crown. Though drawn up by Penn, it was revised by
Lord Chief Justice North and the attorney-general. Sir Wil-
liam Jones. The revisers added the important cbuses to
which reference has been made.

Penn proposed at first to call his province New Wales,
for, as he wrote in a private letter, it was a pretty hilly
country. But, it is said, the secretaiy, who was a Welsh-
man, objected to this name. Penn then suggested Sylva-
nia, and to this the king added " Penn," out of honor for
William's father, the admiral. Penn modestly objected to
this, fearing it would be considered a piece of vanity on his
part. He even ofiiered the under-secretaries twenty guineas
to change the name, but the offer was refused and the
province was called Pennsylvania.

Penn himself gives us a most inteiesting account of the
naming of his province. It appears in a l^er to his friend
Robert Turner, and bears the date March 5, 1681 — the daf
after he came into possession of the charter. After formally
greeting his friend, Penn adds that ^ after many waitings,
watchings, soliciting^, and disputes in council, this day my
country was confirmed to me under the great seal of Eng-
land, with huge powers and privileges, by the name of
Pennsylvania, a name the king would g^ve it, in honour
of my fitther. I chose New Wales, being, as this, a pretty
hilly countiy, but Penn being Welsh for a btad^ as Pen-
manmoire, in Wales, and Penrith in Cumberland, and Penn
in Buckinghamshire, the highest land in England, called this
Pennsylvania, which », ^ high or head umdlands; for I
pioposed, when the ^cretaiy, a Welshman, refused to have
It called New Wales, Sffhai^y and they added Ptun to it,
and though I much opposed it, and went to the king to have
it struck out and altered, he said it was past, and would
take it upon him; nor could twenty guineas move the under*
secretaries to vary the name, for I feared lest it should be
looked on as a vanity in me, and not as a respect in the
king, as it truly was, to my iather, whom he often mentions
with praise."

In the autumn of 1681, a vessel from London and one

from Bristol started out for Penn's province, with colonists

and three commissioners aboard. A third vessel — the Amhy^
from London — did not leave England until April of the next
year. The ynhn and Sarah^ from London, was the fii st vessel
to arrive, and the Bristol Factor soon followed on Decem-
ber The latter vessel anchored at what is Chester
now, but then called rpiaiid. That night the vessel was
c:iu&lt;;ht in (he lee, and the emigrants were compelled to land
and spend the winter at that place. The inhabitants offered
them the best hospitality they could. There was not, how-
ever, sufficient nx)in for all, and some were compelled to
find shelter by digging caves in the ground 01 by making
earthen huts. Some of the colonists were still living in

this manner when Pcnn arrived the next year. There
were, perhaps, at this time two thousand persons in the

province.

Less than a month after the king had signed the patent,
Penn sent his cousin, Colonel William Markham, as deputy
governor, to take possession of the country. He was
instructed to call a council of nine to assist him in the ad-s
ministration of the governmtiu and to determine the boun-
dary lines with Maryland. Courts were to be established
and the peace was to be maintained. In addition to the
king's declantion announcing the grant of the patent and a
command to render obedience, Markham cairied a most
interesting letter addressed to the colonists already settled
in the province. It shows better than anything else Penn*s
liberal intentions on assuming the proprietorship of the
colony.

^My fnends," wrote he, I wish you all happiness, here
and hereafter. These are to let you know that it hath

pleased God, in his providence, to cast you within my lot
and care. It is a business that, though I never undertook
before, yet God has given me an understanding of my duty,
and an honest mind to do it uprightly. I hope you will
not be troubled at your change and the king's choice, for
you are now fixed at the mercy of no governor that comes
to make his fortune great; you shall be governed by laws
of your own making, and live a free, and, if you will, a
sober and industrious people. I shall not usurp the right
of any, or oppress his person. God has furnished me with
a better resolution, and has given me his grace to keep it.
In short, whatever sober and free fnen can reasonably de-
sire for the security and improvement of their own happi-
ness, I shall heartily comply with, and in five nKjnths I
resolve, \i it please God, to see you. In the mean time pray
submit to the commands of my deputy, so far as they are
consistent with the law, and pay him those dues (that for-
merly you paid to the order of the governor of New York)

Penn/*.

Penn*s frame of government was ounpleted and pub-
lished in the spring of 1682. In the preamble he sets forth
his ideas about the origin, nature, and object of govern-
ment. It is of divine origin, he claimed. "Its ohicct is to
encourage the well disposed, to shield virtue and reward
merit, to foster art and promote learnmg." The sovereign
power was to reside in the governor and the freemen ot the
province. The people were to elect two bodies to legislate,
the Couiicii and the Assembly. The proprietor reserved
only for himself the right to preside at the Council and to
have ffaiee votes. His deputy or agent was to have the
same prerogative. Seventy-two persons were to be chosen
by universal suffrage for three years to form a Council.
One-third of these were to retire every year, and their plac^
were to be filled by others newly elected. This popular
body was to prepare and propose bills, and to it likewise
were intrusted the execution of the laws and the preserva-
tion of peace. It could likewise decide upon the sites
of new towns and cities, build forts, harbors, and markets,
make and repair roads, inspect the public treasur)', erect
courts of Justice, c?^tablish primary schools, and reward the
fruits of useful inventions and discoveries."

For the more efficient transaction of business, the mem-
bers of this body were to be divided into four grand com-
mittees: one on plantations; one on justice and safety; one
on trade and treasury; and aiiuthcr on manners, education,
and arts. Authority to convene and prorogue the Assembly
was granted the governor and Council. During the first
year every freeman was to have a seat in the Assembly.
After that time, however, its membership was to be limited
to a representative body of two hundred until the population
justified an increase, but the number was not to exceed five
hundred. Annual elections were to be held and voting was
to be by ballot. The Assembly had the power to confirm

MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



but not to initiate legislation. It could not appoint the
justices and shcrifFs, but could draw up a list of nominees
from which the governor was to choose one-half. The first
draft which Penn made of his charter was somewhat different
from the one he finally gave out and of which we have just
given a synopsis. The first draft made the Assembly similar
to the English House of Commons. It was to have the
same privileges, and, in fact, Magna Charta and all con-
firmatory laws were to form a part of the fundamental law.
Penn signed the second draft of the P rame of Government
on the 25th of April, 1682.

In August, 1682, Penn fitted out the vessel WeUmuy of
three hundred tons, to convey him to hb piovince, hut it
was the ist of Septemher before he and his hundred fellow
passengers finally set sail. During the voyage smallpox
broke out among the passengers. The attack was mild at
first, but later proved to be of such a virulent type that
more than thirty died on the voyage. Penn devoteid him-
self constantly to the alleviation of the sufferings of his
fellow voyagers.

Nine weeks after sailing, toward the end of October,
they anchored in the harbor of New Castle. Here they
were welcomed by the Swedes, £nglish, and Dutch who
had preceded them to the new country. The day after he
arrived, Penn assembled the people in the courthouse and
formally took possession of the province. He made a
speech, asserting as the reason of his coming "a desire to
found a free and virtuous State in which the people should
rule themselves." He spoke to them of the constitution
which he had made for Pennsylvania and likewise promised
the inhabitants of the territory which he had purchased from
the Duke of York the same privileges. The representatives
ot the Duke of York gave Penn the key of the fort and
presented him with "turf and twig, and water and soil of
the River Delaware."

Penn then journeyed on to Upland, a Swedish settlement
founded probably about forty years before. Landing at the

village on Sunday, October 29, 1682, Penn turned to his
friend Thomas Pearson, and said : ^ Providence has brought
us here safe. Thou hast been the companion of my perils.
What wilt thou that I call this place?" Pearson, coming
from the city of Chester, England, replied : Call it Ches-
ter.** Here an assembly was held, which passed the sixty-
one statutes known as the Great Law of Pennsylvania.
Penn now felt that his ^^Holy Experiment" was fairly well
launched.

Penn had instructed his commissioners, who had preceded
him the year before, to select a site tor tht- capital of the
province. After a careful investigation, his surveyor re-
ported that the best place for the city was " the land lying
at the junction of Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, both of
which were navigable." Here there was clay for brick and
near by there were stuiic and marble quai tics. Besides, the
neighboring lands were not swampy. This land was owned
by three Swedish brothers, Svenson by name, and was cov-
ered with a dense forest. The land for the new city, con-
sisting of three hundred and sixty a&lt;:res, was given by the
three brothers upon condition that two hundred acres should
be given to each of them in another part of the city together
with a yearly rent of one half-bushel of wheat for each one
hundred acres.

According to Penn's design, Philadelphia was to cover
twelve square miles. He drew the plan of the city on
paper, with the streets, docks, and open spaces. Two
streets were to front the two rivers and were to be con-
nected by an avenue one hundred feet in width. Streets
and gardens were to adorn this avenue. Running at a right
angle with this there was to be a broad street of equal width
to be called Broad Street. This plan divided the city into
four sections. In the centre there was to be reserved a
public square of ten acres, and in the middle of each of the
four sections there was to be a similar square of eight acres.
Parallel with Broad Street there were to be eight streets fifty
feet in width. Penn's desire was to have a green country

town, " and to make this possible he encouraged the building
of houses surrounded with gardens.

Penn was charmed with the country, and so expressed
himsdf in a Jettcr. how sweet/' wrote he, ^ is the
quiet of these purts, freed from the anxious and troublesome
solicitations, hurries, and perplexities of woeful £urope!"
Continuing, he says the land is like **tlie best vales of £ng-
land wateri»l by brooks; the air, sweet; the heavens, serene
like the south of France ; the seasons, mild and temperate;
vegeuble productions abundant, chestnut, walnut, plums,
muscatel grapes, wheat and other grain; a variety of ani-
mals, elk, deer, squirrel, and turkeys weighing for^ or fifty
pounds, water-birds and fish of divers kinds, no want of
horses; and flowers lovely for colour, crrcatncss, figure, and
variety. . . . The stories of our necessity [have been]
either the fear of our friends or the scarecrows of our ene-
mies; for the greatest hardship we have suffered hath been
salt meat, which by fowl in winter and fish in summer,
together with some poultry, lamb, mutton, veal, and plenty
of venison, the best part of the year has been made very
passable." As regards the climate, however, Penn has an-
other story to tell. He writes ^the weather often cfaangedi
without notice, and is constant almost in its inconstancy/' —
(Clarkson's Life of Fam^ i, 350, 402.)

Penn now turned his attention to die Indians. He had
the year before addressed them a most friendly letter at the
same rime he had addressed the people through his deputy
governor. Colonel Markham. Upon Penn's arrival in his
province, he soon won the love and the adminiuon of the
Indians by going among them freely. He was present at
their feasts, and watched the young men in their dances.
They gave him the name of the great Onas. His treaty
with a tribe of the Delaware or Lcnapc Indians was one
of the most famous events of his first visit to the New
World. Shackamaxon, meaning "the place of the eels,"
was the site of this most famous meeting. This spot had
been used as a meclmg place by the iiidianb even beiore

the arrival of the white men. A ]ai]ge elm tree grew in
thit space, and under tbis Pcnn stood and received the In&gt;
diana, Cblofiel Maihham was at his rig^t. After the re*
oeption, the chief sachem Taiminem advanced a few steps^
put on his head a chaplet into which was twisted a imall
honi, his symbol of authori^, and sat down. On his right
were the older sachems, while the middle-aged warriors
arranged themselves around them in the form of a crescent.
The younger men formed the outer circle. When all were
seated, Taimtnent announced their readiness to tisten to the
governor,

Penn thereupon arose and said : The Great Spirit who
ruled the heavens and the earth, the father of all men, bore
witness to the sinceri^ of his wishes to dwell with them in
peace and friendship, and to serve them with all his power.
Himself and followers had met them unarmed, because their
religion forbade the use of hostile weapons aeainst their
fellow creatures; they came not to injure others, that was
offensive to the Great Spirit, but to do good, in which he
(kljghted-, having met in the broad pathway of truth and
licncvolence, they ought to disdain deception and to regulate
their conduct hv candor, fraternity, ami love."

He then explained his treaty to them, and requested the
sachems to sign it for themselves and their children. They
used no oaths or seals, but the treaty was ratified both by
the Quakers and the Indians with "yea."

Before leaving Chester, Pcnn*s most important act had
been the issuance of writs 10 the siu'titfs of New Ca^ile,
Kciu, Sussex, Chester, Philadelphia, ajid Bucks Counties,
requiring them to summon all freeholders to assemble to
elect representatives in the General Assembly lJuit was
to meet within a month. Before the (all of New Nether*
land, Sussex County was called Hoomkill.'' Later, it
received the name &lt;«WhorekiU/' and then &lt;«Deal." On
December 25, 1682, Penn changed it to ^ Sussex." At the
same time, ^Jones'* County was changed to **Kent."

of the following year* The Assembly met at Chester on
the 14th of December, 1682. Only sixteen of the forty-
two members were present, Nicholas Moore was elected
speaker, and three committees were appointed. One of the
committees was on elections and privileges, another for
the preparation of bills, and a third on justice and griev-
ances. A number of rules were adopted for the government
of the Assembly. Any member could have access to all
committees except those of secrecy. No member could
leave on n iourney during the session, except li\ express per-
mission from the speaker. Any member who should strive
to pervert the meaning of a question was to be expelled.
No member might speak more than twice on a question,
once before and once after it was put, and all long speeches
without special point were to be stopped by the speaker.
Any member could offer a bill, public or private, except a
tax bill. i he use of the names of the members and the
use of all personalities were to be debarred from debate.

It is significant that at this first election of Assembly-
men undue influences were used to elect a member ^m
New Castle. The sheriff of that county employed unlaw-
ful means to procure the election of Abraham Mann. It is
even more significant, perhaps, that after testimony was taken
Mann was expelled and his opponent, John Moll, put in his
phice by a unanimous vote. Although the session lasted but
three days, yet laws of importance were passed. The first
annexed the Lower Counties to the province, and the second
provided a naturalization law. Penn presented to the Assem-
bly copies of the laws which had been prepared and published
in England. These were adopted by the Assembly.

The most important action of this Assembly was, how-
ever, the enactment of "The Great Law." It contained
sixty-nine sections and was presented by Penn. The code
was entitled : "The Great Law, cr, the body of Lt7irf of the

ilate was the first niouth. The first s( c tioji contained the
celebrated provision ibr " liberty of conscience." It read, in
pari, as follows:

" It is enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no person
now or at any time hereafter living in this province, who shall
confess and acknowledge one Almighty God to be the creator,
upholder, and ruler of the world, and that professeth him
or henelf olil%ed in conadence to live pocetUy and justly
under the civU government, shall in anywise he molested or
prejudiced for his or her conscienttoos persuasion or prac-
tice, nor shall he or she at any time he compelled to frnjuent
• or maintain any religious worship, place, or ministry what-
ever, contnuy to his or her mind, hut shall freefy and fully
enjoy his or her Christian liberty in that respect, without
any interruption or reflcctioai and if any person shall abuse
or deride any other for his or her difierent persuasion and
practice in matter of religion, such shall be looked upon as
a disturber of the paace, and be punished accordingly."

Every Christian twenty-one years old and unstained by
crime " was an elector, and was eligible for election to the
Assembly. Every child twelve years old was to be taught
some useful trade. Legal fees were to be low and published
in every court of justice. Persons wron^uUy imprisoned
were to have double damages from the prosecutor.

After a visit to Lord Baltimore, when an ineffectual at-
tempt was made to negotiate a settlement of the boundaries
between the provinces of Pennsylvania and Maryland, Penn
made preparations for the second Assemblv. In addition to
convoking the Assembly, he ordered the election of twelve
men from each county to serve as delegates in the Provincial
Council to be held at Philadelphia. The people departed
from a literal obser\'ancc of the writ by electing twelve
men in all from each county. They petitioned at the same
time that three of these might represent ihem in the Coun-
cil and nine in the Assembly. Although Pcnn granted the
petition, yet the change was not agreeable to at least one
member. Nicholas Moore nLdiii umcd that the change was

grossly unconstitutional and that the action of the Council
was treasonable. For this unreasonable and impudent**
conduct lie wis caUed before the governor and Couiidl and
•eYcrely reprimanded*

Exclusive of the Bill of Settlement, which was the result
of Penn's submission of a new fume of goveinmenty the most
important action taken by this Assembly [1^83] was that
rebttng to the excise. An excise tax and anotner on ex-
ports and impofts were passed. In addition, Penn was asked
to accept the revenues ccMning from a tax of twopence a
gallon on all imported liquors, a penny on dder, and twen^
shiUings on every hundred poiinds* worth of goods imported
in merchandise, with the exception of molasses. F^n ex-
plained, however, that the collection of this duty would be
difficult and costly, and proposed instead that at least £y30
should be raised by voluntary subscriptions for the support
of the government. ^^But some of the collectors were
strangers, and had little influence; others were a little too
great to be much imposed upon, many more were rich, and
still others preferred their own ease to the people's good,''

This Assembly likewise put itself on record as opposing
a life tenure of offices by appointees of the governor, but as
favoriTif^ Pemi's power of appointment during his lifetime.
Furthermore, the basis of representation was increased, the
four grand conuiiittecs of the Council and the governor's
ttrlilc vote were abolished, and the time for hoKiuig the
annual elections for members of the Council and Assembly
was changed to the loth of March. Two peculiar bills
were introduced, but failed to become laws. One com-
pelled young men to marry, and the other sptcihcd thai only
two kinds of clothes should be worn,— one suit for summer
and one for winter.

This Assembly is chiefly notable, however, for the action

Pkovince." Penn conleiTCd with bis Council about the
natter ami decided to tubmit a new fnune of government.
After a Jcng;di/ debace« and with leveial important revitioat,
the Assembly adopted the Bill of Settlement, April 2, 1683.
These were present when the bill was adopted fbuiteen
members of the Council^ — not counting Penn^ — forty-
three members of the Assembly, and four inhabitants of
Philadelphia. The House was given greater legislative
power^and it was provided that all bills should be published
twenty days before the meeting of the Assembly, thus
diminishing the danger of hasty legislation.

The new fnune of government was shortly to be tested.
The first meeting of the Assembly under its provisions was
held in May, 1684. Two Philad^Iphians contested sharply
for the honors of the speakership. Nicholas Moore, who
afterward became chief justice, succeeded in winning the
honor. It was he who had been reprimanded by the gov-
ernor and Counci! dnrino; the second session of the A&lt;;sem-
bly. Twent\ hills that had been previously passed by the
cotincil wcTc cnricted. One of these bills had as its object
the protection of the proprietor and ofhif^ nii;hts. A heavy
penalty was to be inflicted upon anyone who should attempt
to incite the people to hatred of him, or to dispossess him
of his rights.

The hrst three years after Pcnn's arrival witnessed a great
flow of immigrants into Pennsylvania. They came from
various places in England, Wales, Holland, and Germany.
Most of them, though not all, were Quakers. They were
mostly husbandmen, tradesmen, and mechanics. Snmc had
money when thcv came, but most had it U; make \\\ tlie
New World. Some even broii(&gt;ht the frames of their
dwellings with them. They came so fast and in such
large numbers that Penn deemed it wise to buy more land
of the Indians. The records show tbat one purchase included
land ^as far back as a man could walk in three days."
Penn, indeed, had good reason to feel contented with the
success of bis " Holy fixpeiiment." Within diree years

from the time Philadelphia was founded, its population had
reached two thousand tu c hundred, while there were more
than eight thousand |&gt;eopic in the whole province. New
Netherland had not exceeded this growth during the whole
first half-century of its existence. Penn had planned a
school almost as soon as the colony was founded. In
December, 1683, Enoch Flower began to teach in a hut
divided into two apartments. "To learn to read," it cost
^four shillings a quarter; to write, six shillings } boarding a
scholar, to wit, diet, lodging, washing, and schooling, £ 1 0
a whole year." It was six years afterward when the public
school was opened* Geoige Keith was master, and his
stipend was £$0 per .year, besides a house for his lamfly
and school rooms."

Receiving news of the severe illness of his wife, and
other matters requiring his presence in England, Penn de-
cided to return. Before leaving, he called the Indians
together at Pennsbury Manor, his country seat on the Dela-
ware, and told them of his contemplated voyage. He asked
them to live in peace with themselves and with the whites
during his absence. He requested them not to drink too
much fire-water, and at the same ttme forbade his own
people to sell them brandy and firearms. He likewise sent
a circular letter to the Qiiakers of the province, " urging
them to be watchful over themselves, helpful to one another,
circumspect and zealous." After concluding a treaty of
peace with the Indians, Penn sailed in August, 1684, on
the brig EneUavor^ and arrived at his home in Sussex early
in October. He found that the persecution of the Non-
conformists had increased during the time of his absence,
and he immediately set himself at work to try to obtain
pardons for his friends and the adoption of Acts of Tolera-
tion. While in England, his wife died, and m 1696 he
married Hannah Callowhill, of Bristol.

In Penn's absence, the executive power was intrusted to
the Provincial Cbuncil. To Thomas Lloyd, a Welsh Friend,

been absent long before troubles and quarrels arose in the
province. Chief Justice Moore had been impeached by
the Assembly for violence, partiality, and negligence, but
had been acquitted on a technical error in the form of pro-
cedure. Nevertheless, the Assembly succeeded for the time
being in having all places of trust closed to him. Patrick
Robinson, clerk of the Provincial Court, was declared a
public enemy for having refused to produce the minutes of
the Assembly. An ineffectual attempt was made to dis-
qualify him for office. A justice of the peace was dismissed
from office, charged with uttering trcnsonnhle words against
the king, ruid other officials were accused of extortion. It
was furthermore charged that "gross immorahtics were prac-
tised among the lower class of people inhabiting the caves
on the bank of the Delaware." On the other hand, peace
with the Indians had been kept, land improved and sold,
laws enforced, courts established, and elections regularly
held and quietly conducted."

No doubt, one of the chief causes uf trouble was that
Penn*s relation to the colony was of a twofold character.
He was ixxh governor and land owner. Those who were
pressed, however mildly, for payment of their lung overdue
quitrents became angered, and expressed their resentment
by electing representatives who opposed the government
and made every effort to reduce its power. I he Provincial
Council, not proving effective, had transferred its executive
power to five commissioners. Because two of these would
not act, the Council resumed hs executive powers and dis-
charoed its duties until new conunissionen were appointed
in ra&gt;iuary) i688. At the meeting of the Assembly in
1688 ill feeling arose because, cootiaiy to custom, the

Speaker was not presented to the commissioners and Council
for confirmation. The Assembly then transacted its busi*
ness behind closed doois.

Finding that government by commissions was a failure,
Penn in 1688 appointed a single deputy. Captain John
Blackwell, at one time an officer under Cromwell. This
experiment also was far from a success. Blackwcll was in
the province only thirteen months, but during that time the
colony was in one continuous political uproar. The deputy
governor arrested the speaker of the former Assembly for
trying to impeach Chief Justice Moore. He imprisoned
and suspended David Lloyd, clerk of the Supreme Court,
for refusing to hand over to him the records of that court.
Doubting the constitutiojial tv of all laws enacted during
Penn's absence, he suspended them. In attempting to estab-
lish a militia, he was opposed by the Quakers. Thomas
Lloyd was impeached for stirring up discontent and for re-
fusing to sign the acts of the government. One member
of the Council was debarred therefrom for not properly
addressing the governor, and another was arraigned for puln
Jishing a copy of the constitution. Blackwell, in short,
stirred up such an opposition to himself that he realized
that his usefulness was at an end and requested his recall.

To provide for the vacant deputy govemoiship, Penn sent
two commissions, which were to be presented to the Council
for alternative choice. By one commission, the Council was
empowered to select three persons, of whom the one re-
ceiving the largest number of votes was to act in place of
a deputy governor until Penn should appoint one to act
permanently in that capacity. By the other commission,
the Council itself was to act in the place of the deputy and
was given the privilege of electing its own president. Both
these commissions were dated September 25, 1689. The
Council decided upon the second plan, and Thomas Lloyd
was elected president at a session of the Coiuicil held Janu-
ary 2, 1690. The Lower Counties were dissatisfied, fearing
they would be neglected in the distribution of othccs. They

claimed that Philadelphia had robbed them of much of their
business and that they had borne more than their share of
taxation. As they could arrive at no satisfactory under-
standing, these three counties were cut off from the prov-
ince, and Markham was made their lieutenant-governor.
To this separation Penn assented reluctantly, foreseeing that
it would cause future trouble.

A new danger arose. Penn feared that the dissensions in
the province might be made a pretext in England for depriv-
ing him of his patent. His known friendship for James II.
caused him considerable annojrance, and his enemies used
it to stir up additional trouble in the province.

CHAPTER XII



THS RMFOLUnON OP 1688

Louis XIV., with the "wily and indomitable" Frontcnac,
vvns plotting the overthrow of New York. Frontenac was
to return to America with one thousand rcL^uiars, fall upon
Albany, sail down the Hudson, and unite at New York
with a French fleet. This would cut the Iroquois off from
their supply of firearms and would make them an easy con-
quest. After that, New England would also be an easy
capture. But when Frontenac landed in Canada, he found
he had been anticipated h\' the Iroquois, who had laid waste
all southern Canada, with Montreal as a centre, and had
captured a magazine oi rifles and ammunition. Conse-
quently, Frontenac had to give up the conquest of New
York and New England and turn his whole attention to
the Iroquois. This put off the war tenaporarily. But
James IL mw that it had to oomey and set on foot a mo-
mentoits icheme that had great results, among which may
he mentioned the ultimate welfiue of America» and the
ovefthiow of Andros, if not, in truth, the overthrow of
James himself.

When James II. became lung, he brou^t to the throne
a greater knowledge of £nghmd's American colonies than
any other £nglish king^ This was owing to his long and
varied experience, while Duke of York, as a colonial pro-
prietor. As a Catholic, he determined to do all in his

power to establish the Roman Catholic leligion in England
and in the colonies. Furthermore, immediately upon his
accession to the throne, he dctcTmincd to concentrate in
himself all power, both in England and America. We
have seen that, with this object in view, he had revoked
the charter of New York which as Duke of York he had
granted freely. The people of New York had rejoiced
greatly when James was proclaimed king. They hoped
that since he had interested himself so much in that colony
while duke, this interest would be continued when he became
king. Nor did his intefiest in the colony wine in the
slightest, but it manifested itself in quite a difierent way
from what the colonists expected.

In x686, James's plan for the unification of all the Eng-
lish northern colonies took form at Whitehall, It was
determined that in order to render them more capable of
defending their borders against the French in Canada, these
colonies should be united under one head. Then, again,
two other reasons for unification should be urged in addition
to the pressing necessity for defence against the French:
first, the advisability of cementing a strong; alliance with
the Iroquois League; and secondly, the determination of
James to strengthen his arbitrary power. It must be kept in
mind always that the last mentioned was the all-controlling
reason with the king. Evervthine; else was subsidiary. To
make his own power at hojiic and in the colonies absolute,
it was necessary to checkmate the French in their aggres-
sion upon the American borders. To accomplisli this, it
was indispensable that the northern colonies should present
a united front to the French, and that the Iroquois League
should be propitiated. The one controlling thought with
James, we may repeat, was his extreme selfishness and his
conscienceless determination to make his power absolute
whatever m^ht be the results.

Circumstances seemed to favor his plans. Massachusetts
had been worsted in its quarrel with Charles II. and its
charter had been annulled on a writ of pt» warranu in

1685. Plymouth had never secured a charter. Writs of
quo warranto had been issued against the charter of Con-
necticut in 1685. The charter of Rhode Island had been
proceeded against in the lanie waf in 1686, though Androt
did not get pottetsioa of thedociinient any mofe than he did
of the chatter of Connecticut,

When James finalif decided upon this contdtdatton of
New Engjand^ he loolwd about him for a man to put at the
head of afiirt to cany out hit arfaitnuy rule. Hia choice
ky between Colonel Thoous Dongan, Governor of New
York, and Sir Edmund Androi. He finally decided upon the
latter, whom he had previously sent out as Governor of New
York. Dongan, althougb a Catholic, was dbphced. From
his long American eacperience,**his administrative ability, his
incproachable private chaiacter, and, above all, hit soldieriy
notions of prompt obedience to ordeis," Andros was just
the agent to execute the king't arbitrary drsigns. Although
fond of prelacy, he was not a Ronun Catholic* He reached
Boston on the 20th of December, 1686, as captain^eneral
and governor of all New England, which included Massa-
chusetts Bay, New Plymouth, New Hampshire, Maine, and
the Narragansett country, or the King's Province. He was
given the authority to make laws and levy taxes, with the
consent of a council appointed bv the crown. He was to
allow no printing }&gt;rcsses, except by special license. He
was to encourage episcopacv, and ti&gt; sustain authority hy
force. Personal liberty and rlic customs of the country were
to be disregarded. None might leave the colony without a
special permit. Probate fees were to be increased almost
twenty-fold. Two companies of soldiers, mostly Irish
Romanists, were raised in London and placed at Andros's
disposal, in order that he might be able mure effectively to
execute the kmg's orders. The governor was to receive
£1^100 as his salar\ .

New Yot Iv, hccuuhc of its pcculi^ir relations to the Iro-
quois and to Canada, its great extent of territory, and its
wealth, had demonstrated that a separate government was

for it a Jiccessity. But James II., pleased with the result
of the consolidation of the New England colonies, deter-
mined, in spite of New York's claim to a separate govern-
ment, to take a Anther step. New Yoik and the Jersejrs
were to be induiied in tbe unification scheme. In this
way, all the territory which the patent of James L» of 1620,
had named ^New England in America" would be brought,
for tbe first time, under one rojal English governor. Penn»
•jrlirania, possibly because the king stood in need of Pcnn's
gcxid will, was not to be included in the union. But all tbe
rest of British North America, between Delaware Bay and
Fiassamaqubddjr Bay, and stfetching across the continent from
the Atlantic to tbe Pacific, was to be made a political iHiok
under the govemofBhip of one man, to be chosen by the
kins. Later, action was taken likewise agunst the charters
of Maiyland and Ckiolina, but the proceedings in these
cases were not carried to an issue.

With this end in view, James revoked New York's half-
granted charter and annexed that colony to New England.
Dongan was notified of the change, and instructed to de-
liver to Andros the seal and recoids of the province. The
former was assured that James was entirely satisfied with
h» services in the ^most important British possesrion in
America,'* and that he would be rewarded upon his return
to Engbuid. On Saturday, the iith of August, 1688, the
new governor-general reached New York in state. He was
received by Colonel Bayard's regiment of foot and a troop
of horse. The king's new commission was read in Fort
James, and then published at the City Hall. Immediately
afterward, Andros sent for and received from Dongan the
sea! f&gt;f the late goverjinieiu cjf New York. This he broke
in the presence of the members of the Council, accordmg
to the king's instructions. In its stead, the great seal of
United New England was thenceforth to be used. A proc-
lamation was at once issued retaining in office all persons not
removed by order of the king, and directmg that the taxes be
continued.

It was planned that.Andros should have a Council com-
posed of forty-two of the principal men from the colonies
included in his Dominion of New England in America."
No place was fixed upon by the king as the capital of this
dominion, but Andros quietly sssumcd tbat B&lt;wton would
serve his purpose best. The governor was to coinniunicate
to his Council such of the royal instructions as he should
find conveniem. These councillors were to enjoy freedom
of debate, and seven of them were necessary to constitute a
quorum* In extiaoidinaiy emergencies, however, a smaller
number was given permission to truisact business* By the
advice and consent of a majority of the Council, laws could
be made and taxes imposed. The governor was authorised
to suspend any councillor for good and sufficient causey
and he wis required to nominate to the Plantation Com-
mittee penons fit to supply vacancies. In aU appointments,
whether councillors, judges, sherifis, or any officers
whatsoever, the governor-general was always to observe the
peatest precautions. Especial care was to be taken that
men of estite and ability thoroughly in harmony with the
government should be selected. Necessitous people " or
people heavily In debt were to be ignored. All laws within
the colonies at the time of unification were to remain in
force until the governor and his Council should make others.
Libeny of conscience in all religious matters was to be
guaranteed to all law-abiding persons, in accordance with
the king's declaration of April 4, 1687. Nothing was said
about the Church of England in the instructions sent to
Andros. Captain Francis Nicholson, coniiiiandcr of a
company of the kin^r's regulars stationed at Boston, was
commissioned )irutc]UiiU-f!;rn'ernor.

Almost immediately upon Aiuirus's landing at Boston,
Indian affairs claimed his attention. The day he reached
New York he announced his arrival to the Marquis dc
Denonviiic, who represented French interests in Canada.
He maintained that the Indians of the Five Nations \\ rre
British subjects, and requested that the French should do

them no injury. As Indian affairs were not running
smoothly enough to suit Andros, he determined to go to
Albany. He was accompanied by several of his councillors
and fifty soldiers, and after leaching Albany he was joined
by Nicholson, the lieutenant-governor, who came from
Boston via Springfield. The Five Nations sent delegates
to Albany to meet Andros and his councillors, and an
interview was held in the town house. Here Andros was
welcomed by the orator of the Mohawks, Sindacksegie.
The next day, the meeting being continued, Andros ad-
dressed the Indians as "Children" and assured them they
need now have no fears, inasmuch as the French and the
English were friends. The Iroquois promised to have
nothing to do with the French, but to treat them as friends,
as Andros requested. 1 he Mohawks expressed the desire
that the old covenant that had been made with their an-
cestors be kept Hrm. *'Then we were called Brethren, and
that was also well kept; therefore, let the name firethren
continue, without any alteration/* They requested Andros
to endeavor to secure the release of the Indians who had
been carried oflT as prisoners to France. ^The Governor
of Canada,'* said the Indian, &lt;*is pleasant with his eye, and
speaks fair with his lipS} but his heart is corrupt, and we
find that the old covenant made with this government has
been kept inviolate." Andros promised to do what he
could to secure the return of the prisoners from France,
and the following day — the 21st of September, 1688 — the
conference ended.

After a stay of two months in New York and Albany,
Andros returned to Boston in October, 1688, to prevent if
possible a second Indian war. The Indians of Maine had
given considerable trouble near Casco Bay, and volunteer
troops had been sent thither from Boston without orders from
the governor-general. Andros took u ith him such of the
New Yf rk records as he deemed necessary to have at hand
duruiLi his ahscnce. Nicholson was left in charge of affairs
in New York, with the local councilors as advisers. 1 he

people of New York did not relish this tyianmcal treat-
ment. In the fiist place, they were most vehemently op-
posed to the annexation of New York to New England.
Geographically, politically, and socially, New York was
miltke the New England colonies. Anneication ignored
their natural and proper sentiments of local patriotum.'*
However, they were not to be deprived of their identity
much longer. Outside forces were working in their favor.
England was on the veige of a political uplwavaL

The rule of Andros in New England was insufimUe.
Here be carried things with a high hand. Unusual taxes
were imposed without authority, little regard was had for
the English common law, the press was closely muzzled, the
writ of haheas corpus was suspended, and land titles were
questioned that the officials might exact fees for new patents.
I'he public records of all the defunct New England colonies
were lodged in Boston, and those who desimi to consult
them were compelled to make a tedious and costly journey
to that city. All deeds and wills, likewise, were registered
there, and excessive fees were charg^ for their registry.
The colonial representative assemblies were abolished, and
the power of taxation was taken from the town meetings
and given to the governor-general. When the Rev. John
Wise protested in behalf of his town of Ipswich against
this last act, he was thrown into prison and fined a sum
equal to |l 1,000 in money of to-day, and then deprived of
his ministerial orders.

The New England people could endure Andros no
longer. Increase Mather, president of Harvard College,
headed a commission that was sent over to England to
protest against Andros's tyrannical arts. Mather presented
addresses of thanks which he had bruiiL'ht from New Eng-
land, and afterward submitted complaiut^ of the "enslaved
and pcnshnig estate" uf ihe inhabitants, bv reason of the
misgovernment ot Andros. He was kindly received by
James. But all final action was prevented by the Revolution
of 1688.

James II.'s arbitrary rule and predilection for the Roman
Catholic religion caused first dissatisfaction among his sub-
jects and finally rebellion. The opinion that the King of
En^nd should be a Protestant was held alike by Episco-
palians and Dissenters. Religious sects and political parties
combined against the Catholic king. With one accord
they turned to the Calvinist husband of Princess Mary as
their " Deliverer." An invitaticm was accordingly sent to
William of Orange, the Stallholder of the Dutch Republic,
imploring him to come to their rescue. The long pent-up
rebellion burst forth when on the 5th of November, 1688,
William's expedition lajided at Brixham, in Devonshire.
Before the end of November, Englishnun of every rank
and influence gathered round the standard of the Prince of
Orange. James, at last realizing his danger, disbanded the
royal army, threw the great seal into the Thames, and
finally, with William's connivance, embarked for Fiance on
December 23d. Before Christmas, the last Stuart king had
become a royal guest of Louis XIV, of France, and in
England there was a vacant throne. William and Mary
accepted the profiered crown on February 13, 1689, and
were proclaimed King and Queen of England. Their first
act was the confirmation of all Protestants in the offices
they held on the preceding ist of December. This procla-
mation did hot, however, affect the English colonies.

When the news reached America late in March, 1689,
that William and Mary had accepted the throne, it was
hailed with uncontrolled joy. On April i8th, armed yeo-
manry began to pour into Boston. Andros now realized
that the end of his rule had come. He tried to o-ct aboard
a frigate in the harbor, thinking thereby to escape to New
York, where he might find refuge. But the Yankees were
too quick for him. He was caught and thrown into jail,
together with Chief Justice Joseph Dudley, who had in-
sulted the people of New England by telling them that the
only liberty left them was that of not being sold for slaves.
Massachusetts lesiured its old government. Plymouth,

Rhode laiand, and Connecticut quietly did the same. Androt
was sent to England for trial the next year, but the colo-
nists' complatnts were dismisfed. He governed Viigpntt
from 1692 to 1698. From 1704 to 1706, he was gpT-
emor of the ishuid of Jersey. He afterward removed to
London, where he died on Fehniary 24, 17 14.

Thus came to an in^ofious end the tyrannical rule of
Sir Edmund Andros as governor-general of United New
England. It is difficult to form a correct estimate of his
character, though there cannot be two opinions as to his
ability. He was probably better fitted for the post to which
James appointed him than any other man of the time. The
estimate put upon his chn meter hv early New England
writers cannot be nccepted without considerable qualifica-
tion. Thev almost to a man denounced Antlros as a
**mere bigot, and minion, and tyrant, with hardly a re-
deem mt^; trait." But he simply carried out to the letter the
instructions of a biiioted and tyrannical king. Hroadhead*s
estimate of him, though far from correct, is certainly more
liberal : " He was not to blame because James had directed
New England to be governed without an Assembly, by
himself and his councillors. Andros's duty was to execute
his sovereign's commands; and ihii; he did with character-
istic energy^ — faithfull\ , fearlessly, and sometimes harshly."
Neither was he to blame for the fact that New Yoik, which
had always been peculiarly free in her government, had lost
that freedom and had been annexed lu James's New Eng-
land colony. This was the result of the king's plan, and
Andros, unfortunately for himself, was the man chosen to
govern the new dominion and carry out that plan. ^^For
everything done by each of his subordinates, the governor
was held retponsilile. Most of his own acts were able and
scttesmanlike, though some cfaem were aibitrary and pro-
Toking. The real fiiult of Androt was that he administered his
goveniment too loyally to his sovereign, and too much like a
bfave soldier. VHiat b called loyalty iften depends on fash-
ion or aosdent. Instead of conciliating, Andros wounded j

(Broadhtad, Histofj of Xiiv York^ ii, 526—527.)

Shortly after William's accession to the throne, he pre-
pared a short letter addressed to the American colonies,
enjoining them to retain all James's arrangements undis-
turbed until he should have the opportunity of putdng into
operatbn his own plans. Thii did not pIcMe lamaie
Mather, who saw thiit if the letter was delivered pioaiptly
it might result in sustaining Andros in power for a lo^er
time. Aided by Sir WilUam Phipps, Mather succeeded in
having delayed the tnuismission of thn letter of the 12th of
January. It did not reach Boston until May 29th, by whkh
time Massachusetts was in rebellion and Andros was in
prison. On learning of this state of aflOurs, Phipps, who
had bfDuglit other official letten in addition to the one men-
tioned above, opened them. The same afternoon, William
and Maiy were proclaimed king and queen at Boston,
*^with greater ceremony than had been known.*' The
Massachusetts authorities thereupon decided to continue

This New England revolution, starting at Boston, ex-
tended rapidly to 3ie Chesapeake. Its object was Protestant
liberty. Massachusetts at once restored its old government,
just as if its charter had not been annulled. The other
New England colonies followed suit — Plymouth, Rhode
Island, and Connecticut resumed their old governments as
if nothing had happened. The revolution restored to Eng-
land her legislative privileges, vindicated her chartered
rights," and guaranteed to her legislative body the sole privi-
lege of taxation. Lilce results were either secured to the
colonial governments or doggedly claimed by them.

Penn, who was in Kni^land at the time of Wiiiiam ar.u
Mary's accession to the throne, received orders to have the
new sovereigns proclaimed in Pennsylvania. However, the
proclamatinn was not forwarded immediately, and the delay

against him. He was accused of sympathy with the Jacobite
plots, because of his friendship for James II. On account
of these accusations he was forced to live for some time

almost lilce a prisoner*

The announcement of the overthrow of the government
of Andros, and the success of the English Revolution, re-
sulted in a severance of the political union between the
Jerseys and New York. Thereafter, for twelve years,
the political condition of the former bordered on anarchy.
Nevertheless, during the entire period the Puritans in East
Jersey and the Quakers in West Jersey appear to have
managed their local a£^rs, through their town organizations,
safelf and orderly.

Tile first news of William's invasion of £n^and had
been brou^t to New York on a coasting vessel from Vip»
ginia in Febniaiy, 1689. Nicholson could hardly believe
the report, but shortly afterward Leisler received confirma&gt;
tion of it from Maryland. Nicholson suppressed the news
for a time, as he feared trouble, but it was despatched to
Andros In Maine by both land and water. New York, for
a time after the news of the accession of William and
Mary had been reported, refused to take action until orders
had been received from the king;. Finally, however, in
June, the accession of both monaichs was proclaimed. If
in Massachusetts the aniuiuneement had led to immediate
revolt, in New York it led to open, armed, and, for a while,
completely successful rebellion.

In this critical state of affairs, had Nicholson been equal
to his position he might have saved New York from the
unfortunate incidents that now pressed upon it in rapid
succession, " But the lieutenant-governor," says Broadhead,
**was a regular parade sddier. Without the directing mind
of Andros, he shrank into insig^ficance." Had Andros
been at Foit James instead of being locked up in a Boston
jail, or had he been killed in the Massachusetts insurrection
— everything might have gone well, for a time at least. But

connection with New York afBun was concerned, Nichol-
son did not know what, to do* He was afraid either to
assume responsibility or not to assume it; and thus cau^
fast midway between prompt action and criminal inactivity,
he hesitated, and, hesitating, lost everything. Of course,
technically, Nicholson was in a peculiar position. He had
received no official notification and directions from William,
and could not recognize an Fnelish sovereign of whose
accession he had not been officially notified — at least, so he
thought. Yet Nicholson knew William and Mary had
been proclaimed in Boston on the arrival of Phipps with
the Privy Council's despatches for Andros. He had like-
wise received the London Gazette announcing their acces-
sion, and might have been justified in violating offic ial forms
in view of the critical condition of affairs in New York, But
Nicholson took au such responsibility upon himself. He
was a fair example of a ^^straightforward English official
bound by red upe." Not having instructions from his
immediate chief, he refused to act without them.

This critical state of aflairs in the province was veiy
much complicated when, on the 27th of -April, news was
received of the declaration of war made upon Great Britain
and Holland by Louis XIV. Although the announcement
was premature^— war not being declared until May yth^— yet
it had all the force of a certainty. War had been antici-
pated for several years, and there seemed to have been pre-
monition of the bloody struggle that lasted eight years and
is known in America as King Wiliiam's War and in Europe
as the War of the League of Augsburg. William, as Stad-
holder of the United Provinces, on May 12^ T68g, entered
into an offensive and defensive alliance with the Emperor
of Germany against Louis. As King of England, on
May 17th, he declared war against France, and on Decem-
ber 30th England joined the Grand Alliance. Spain followed
on June 6, 1690, and Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, on
October 20th. War continued until 1697, when it was
brought to a close by the Peace of Ryswick.

Conditions never seemed nmrc ripe for a French iiu asion
of New York tlun iiuvv. Louis was still the most power-
ful factor in European politics, and liis spirit of Catholic
propagandism was an important clement with which to
reckon. There were the elements for an anti-Catholic
paiiic in New York. James had planned the establatlmient
of the Roman Catholic Church in the American colonies.
The two legjiments of regiikr troops were composed of
Romanists, and one of these had been commanded bj
Nicholson himself $ and Nicholson, though an Episcopih
iian, was suspected of Catholic sympathies.

As soon as Nicholson received news of the declaiation
of war, he took steps to guard Fort James and stationed
sentinels on Coney Island to repoR the approach of French
ships. In the midst of these preparations a consignment
of wine arrived from Europe for Jacob Letsler, a well-known
wine merchant. Letsler refused to pay the duty, on the
ground that the collector of the port was a Roman Catholic
and that since James's Pight there was no duly constituted
government in New York. Leisler was a German, bom
at Frankfort&gt;on-the-Main. After coming to New York,
he became a prosperous merchant, and married a connection
of Bayard and Van Cortlandt. Bold and cunning, Letsler
had some of the characteristics of a successful demagogue,
though he lacked in judgment. On the other hand, in
business he was noted as a man of integrity, and it is snid
he was kirifi-henrted mci rrnierous. It '.vas perfect! v evident,
howev er, that he was just the man to be ui H uein c d hv the
condition of affairs \n New Yoric at this critical time. He
was d&lt;*tninated principally by two ideas, namely, his hatred
of Popery and his dislike of aristocratic tendencies, whether
exemplified in social or political life.

Nicholson himself precipitated the insurrection by a most
injudicious ca( lamation. On May 30th, having entered
into an altercation \\ itii a lieutenant in one of the train-
bands, he rashly exclamicd: "Who commands this fort,
^ uu ui I f . . • I would rather sice the city on hre

than take the impudence of audi fellowa as jou." Already
•utpicious of Nicholson's intentions, the people were now
certain that he meant to betray the city to the French. A

movement was immediately set on foot, the result of which
was the capture of the fort. Leisler, himself a captain of
one of the train-bands, took command. Leisler thereupon
drew up a declaration, which was signed by some of those
who had assisted him in seizing the fort. This declaration
referred to "Dongan*s Popish" government and charged
Nicholson with having threatened to set the city on fire.
It announced further that the possession of the fort would
be retained until the existing rulers of England sent properly
qualified persons to receive it. To all objections to his
revoltttionaiy conduct^ Leisler replied: ^ What, do you talk
of law? the sword must now rule." A week from the day
that this announcement was read to an applauding multitude,
on the loth of June, Nicholson sailed for England.

Leisler and four other captains then sent an address to
William and Maiy, in which they gave a detailed narrative
of recent events and promised entire submission to their
majesties* pleasure. Leisler next invited each of the coun-
ties aiul the neighboring towns to send delegates to New
York on the 26th of June, to form a Committee of Safety.
In response to his invitation some of the counties and towns
sent delegates. New York, Brooklyn, 1 latbush, flushing,
Newtown, Staten Island, Orange, Westchester, and Essex
in New Jersey, each sent two. Not a third of the inhabit-
ants of the province registered their votes in the election.
Most of the towns in Queens County and in New Jersey^
and all in Suffolk, Ulster, and Albany Counties, refused to
take part in it.

On the 26th of June, 1689, Leisler^s convention assem-
bled at the fort in New York* Two of the delegates soon
withdrew, perceiving that the main drift of the convention
was to make Leisler commander-in-chief. Ten remained,
and these formed themselves into a Committee of Safety*
The next day this committee sigiied a commission appointing

fiom £ii|^d. Furthennoie, the people of the city and
county^ were required to render him all aid and assistance in
iupi^essing any foieign enemy and in preventing all disorders
which mig^t develop.

Lcislcr, having succeeded in placing himself at the head
of aflfairs in New York, next tried to assume authority over
the inhabitants of other parts of the province. He met with
resistance at Albany. The people of that town readily pro*
claimed William and Mary, but refused point-blank to
recognise X^eisler's authority. They declared ^nhey were
not in any wise subordinate to the city of New York, nor
the power then exercised therein." Letsler, galled at this
defiance of his authority, sent Jacob Milbome with an armed
force to take possession of the fort at Albany. He arrived
on November 9, 1689, demanded admission to the fort.
This was refused by Mayor Schuyler, who had been placed
in command of the fort. For two days Milborne occupied
his time making speeches in the City Hall, on the streets,
or, in fact, in anv place where he could get people to listen to
him. He declared he had been appointed by the authorities
ot New York to assume charge of afiairs at Albany. His
spceche*; ha\ iiig little effect on the people, he determined to
take bolder methods to gain his desire. He collected his
forces, marched to the fort, and again deman&lt;ied its sur-
render. Upon being met with a second refusal, he withdrew
his company within the citv {rates. Upg^n the Mohawks*
threatening to make conimon cause with the Albanians
against him, Milborne was cexiipelkd to dismiss his men.
On the 1 6th of November Leislcr 's baffled emissary returned
to New York, having utterly failed in his mission.

Akhuugh Lcisler failed at first to bring Albniu uiider hts
authority, his power in New York increased daily. lie had
diligently caused rumors of Popish plots to be circulated.
He had seized special letters addressed to "such as may
bear rule for the time being," egotistically assuming that
they were meant for himself. Those he read, and acted

upon the orders contained in them. *He caused Councillor
Bayard and William Nicolls to be arrested, claiming that
the former was the insdgaitor of a plot against the peace of

New York.

The Committee of Safety, who were mere tools of
Leisler, signed a commission delivering over to the latter
the pov CI nmcnt of the entire province. He was empowered
to administer oaths, to issue warrants, and, moreover, to do
anything he thought advisable for the preservation and pro-
tection of the peace of the inhabitants. The only quali-
iicatton was that he should consult with the milttuy and
civil Authorities, as occasion should require. Even the
Albany authorities, in the following spring, being annoyed
by domestic troubles and the fear of Frontenac's move-
ments, by the advice of Connecticut, acknowledged Leisler^s
authority.

Leisler soon found himself without revenues to defray
the expenses of the province. He proclaimed the statute
of 1683 as still in force. This turned the people against
him. They tore down the proclamation, and the merchants
refused to pay the duties. Leisler resorted to fines, im-
prisonments, conRscations, until his popularity was turned
first into distrust and then into hatred.

The unsuccessful expedition of Milborne against Albany
occurred in November, and Frontenac hatl arrived in Canada
just before. He determined to send war parties against the
exposed English frontier towns along the Mohawk and
the Hudson. Three raiding panics were sent out^-^he
first was ordered to Hudson River, the second into New
Hampshire, and the third into Maine. There were about
two hundred and ten men in the first party — one hundred
French Canadians and ninety-six Indians; They were led
by Frenchmen of quality, among whom was Le Moyne
d'lberville.

The raid of the Five Nations upon Montreal in 1 689,
to which reference has been made, was the immediate cause
of Frontenac's sending these three expeditions against the

EngUsh. The iiist expedition resulted in the frightful
massacre of the sleeping citizens of Schenectady on the
nig^t of the 8th of Februaiy, 1690. The villa^ might
have been amply protected by troops and fortifications.
In &amp;ct, the Albany committee expected an attack. Then
why were the gates of the village open, no sentinels sta-
tioned, no scouting parties in the vicinity, and no adequate
garrison stationed in the town ? The answer is, Schenec-
tady, like Albany, was rent by party spirit, the inhabitants
being divided into Leislerians and anti-Leislerians-^r the
** short-hairs" and the "swallow-tails,** as they were called.

The Schenectady horror had two very important results —
one permanent and the other merely temporary. They
were, the calling of the first American Congress and the
strengthening of Leisler*s authority. A few words concern-
ing each will be in place.

The intelligence of the burning of Schenectady spread
through the colonies like wildfire. The Governor of Mas-
sachusetts urged in letters to other colonies the necessity
for immediate action to provide for the common defence.
The General Court of Massachusetts, wishing to organize
a joint effort of the colonies, proposed to hold a congress.
The call was dated March 19, 1690. It stated that, in
view of the atrocities that had been committed against the
English by the French and Indians, the neighboring coIo*
nies, and Virginia, Maryland, and the parts adjacent, should
be invited to meet at New York to determine upon suitable
methods for assisting each other for the safety of the whole
land. The Governor of New York was desired to trans-
mit this invitation to the Southern colonies. This was the
first call for a general congress in America. ^*It is free
from narrowness, liberal in its spirit, simple in its terms, and
comprehensive in its objects.*'

Thomas Hinckley, Governor of Plymouth, appointed a
commissioner to the conp;ress, though the General Court was
not ill session. He was zealously in favor of the congress.
Henry Bull, the Quaker Governor of Rhode Island, said.

though the time wis too short to convene the Astembly

for the purpose of appointing a commissioner, yet he prom-
ised the aid of that colony to the utmost of its ability to
resist the French and Indians. The head of the conven-
tion of Maryland wrote that it was the design of the Assem-
bly to send arms and men to aid in the general defence.
President Bacon, of Virginia, replied that the proposition
would require the action of the Assembly, and that noth-
ing could be done until the arrival of the daily expected
governor. Commissioners from Massachusetts, Plymouth,
Connecticut, and New York colonies met at New York,

The results of the congress were unanimously efiected.
On Ma)r zst an agreement was ngned by five colonie^^
Maryland promising to cooperate — to raise dg^t hundred
and fiftyofive men to strengthen Albany and, ^by the help
of Alm^ty God," to subdue the French and Indian ene-
mies. Of this force, New York was to furnish four hun-
dred; Massachusetts, one hundred and sixty; Plymouth,
sixty; Connecticut, one hundred and thirty-five; and Mary-
land, one hundred. In addition, the Iroquois sachems were
to equip one thousand eight hundred warriors. Massachu-
setts was to provide most of the naval armament. The
lieutenant-governor of New York was to name the com-
mander of the force, and that force was not to be employed
on any other service without the consent of the five colo-
nies. Officers were to preserve among their men good
order, punish vice, keep the Sabbath, and maintain the
worship of God. Efforts were made to obtain addiiional
aid from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. No
proposition seems to have been entertained for a permanent
ofganization.

Another direct though temponuy result of the massacre
of Schenectady was the strengthening of Ldsler^s power, as
is evidenced by the final surrender of Albany to his authority.
But the untenable character of his position was exposed, as
we have seen, upon his attempting to summon a legislature
for the purpose of raising money for the expenses of the

govemmcnc. Some peiBoiis refiued to pay tixcs, on the
ground that Leisler wu a ustuper. Likewise, some towns,
notably the Yankee towns on Long Island, refiised to send
lepiesentatives to the Assembly.

The immediate cause, however, of the waning of Lcisler^s
authority may be tiaced to the (ailuie of the escpedition sent
out against the French and Indians in Canada as a result
of the co i ^pess at New Yoric The naval expedition sailed
up the St. LawKnce under Sir William Phipps and laid si^
to Quebec. The allied forces under Fits-John Winthrc^
of Connecticut, marched from Albany toward Montreal;
but the forces merely "marched up the hill and then
marched down again/* Frontenac had outwitted them.
Dissension in the confederate army, however, was the im-
mediate cause of failure. Leisler lott prestige by the miscar-
riage of this e3cpedition,and the dissatis^ction that had been
hidden up to this time began to assert itself. Complaints
were made upon every side, and protests against his govern-
ment were sent to England. The Assembly did not meet
until Octcfber, but when it did it put itself on record as being
the most despotic Assembly that had met in any colony.

The inhabitants of Hempstead, Jamaica, Flushing, and
Newtown met and wrote to the king's secretary of state.
They complained of the tyrannical acts of Leisler, Milborne,
and their accomplices. They said Milborne was famous
for nothing but infamy. That he had plundered houses,
stripped women of their apparel, and secjuestered estates.
They begged the kinp; to break this *'hen\ \' ) okc of worse
than Egvpttuii hnixlafii^ ." They said the cnaies that f^eisler
had committed would force him to take shelter under Cati-
line's maxim — "the ills that i have done cannot be safe but
by attempting greater."

Matters went from bad to worse. The new year, 1691,
dawned ^loomilv. The wrath of the people was held in
clieck &lt;)fil\ h\ the fort. Leisler resorted to the most ex-
treme nu asurcs for the collection of taxes, liven Jx-isler's
friends began to desert him, for they could nou restrain him.

He lost popularity rapidlv. "The dnnmncs came in and re-
buked him in the name uf the l^ord. ( )ld women tauiucd
and defied him on the street, and the mob threw stones
at him and called him * Uog Driver,' * Deacon Jailer,*
M^ittle Ciomwell,* 'General Hog,' and other choice epi-
thets." It waj» evident that the great demagogue had fallen
from honor.

On September 2, 1689, the king appointed Colonel Henry
Sloughter Governor of New York. Sloughter probably se-
cured this post througii the influence of some of Williun't
comipc coiiftien, for it has been said that he was utterly
destitute of every qualification for govemment, that he was
licentioiis in hb mofib, mviridoiiSt and poor.

Finally, after a great many delays, on December 1690,
Sloughter set sail for New York in the fr^ate Arihmngel^
which was to convoy tlie Bunnty the Cmmrtmy^ and the
stoieship John and Jmntt* Two conipanics of stddiers were
in the expiedition, one under the command of Sough ter, and
the other under the command of Major Richard Ingoldsby,
the lleutenant'^venior,**a rash, hot-headed man," who had
formerly served in Holland and had just returned from vic-
torious service under William in Ireland. The little ieet
WIS separated by severe storms, and the Archanfjd^ carrying
the governor and his company, ran ashore on one of the
Bermuda Islands. This necessitated a delay for repairs.
The other three ships, however, were aUe to proceed to
their destination. On the 29th of January, Ingoldsby
arrived in New York. He immediately sent a message to
Leisler, demanding the fort and its stores for the king's
soldiers. Leisler refused to yield the fort unless Ingoldsby
should produce written orders from the king or the governor.
The licutenant-cr&lt;^vcrnor had no documents in proof of his
official standinjj;, thc\' being; on hturcl the Archangel. Leisler
took him tu br a Cathobc cdnspiratni w ho wanted to set/.c the
colony for James. Ingoldsby quartered his troops in the City
Hall, and wrote to the New England governor for advice.
He was urged to bear with Leisler until the governor should

arrive to simplify matters. But proclamation auid counter
proclamation, threat and counter threat, passed between
the two factions until afiairs came to a crisis on March 17,
1 69 1. Leisler, goaded on by opposition and popubr dis-
content, fired upon the king's troops as they stood on
parade. Other shots were fired, and several soldiers were
wounded and two were killed. These shots were answered,
but, safely intrenched behind the breastworks, Leisler*s
forces did not suffer.

Ingoldsby put himself on the defensive, and was relieved,
March 19th, by the intelligence that Sloughtcr had arrived.
As soon as he heard of the conditif^n of affairs at New York,
Sloughter hastened to the City Hall and read his com-
niissiun. After swearing in the new councillors, he sent
Ingoidsby to the fort to denumd of Leisler its surrender.
Leisler refused to comply with the demand, but sent Mil-
borne and De la Noy to make terms with Sloughter. The
governor imprisoned the messengers, and for the third time
demanded the surrender of the fort. J cislcr now saw that
it was useless to hold out longer, and surrendered on Friday,
the 20th of March. All the men were promised a pardon
except Leisler and his councillors, who were imprisoned.
The Assembly, which had been summoned on the day of
Leisler's arrest, met in April, One of iu first acts was the
dechration that Leisler was guilty of an act of rebellion. A
packed jury was drawn and the trial began on March 30th.
The prisoners were charg^ with treason and murder. Eight
of the prisoners pleaded "not guilty." Leisler and Milborne
refused to plead, and they were tried as mutes. After eight
days, the jury pronounced them guilty, together with six
others. Two were acquitted. Chief Justice Joseph Dudley
pronounced the sentence of death upon the eight condemned
men. The prisoners petitioned for a reprieve until the king's
pleasure should be known, and it was granted.

All the condemned men, save Leisler and Milbornc, were
pardoned. The governor could not resist the flood uf peti-
tions that came in, demandmg the execution of these two.

It has been said that the governor was offered large sums
of money to sign the death warrants, and that his wife, from
sheer covetotisness, forced him to do it. The historian Smith
says Sloughter was a guest of the worst enemy of Leisler,
Colonel Bayard, and when overcome with wine was pie*
vailed upon to sign the death warrants, and before he recov-
ered his senses the prisoners had been executed* This can
hardly be true, inasmuch as the warrants were signed on
I'hursday and the execution took place on the Sunday fol-
lowing. Dominic Schyns was the messenger sent to break
the trrrihlc news to the unhappy men. They petitioned
Sloughter lor a reprieve, but it was not granted. On the
15th of May, 1 69 1, Leisler and Milborne were hanged
near old Tammany Hall, in New York.

The event was variously judged. Some jurists pro-
nouju cd the whole proceedings perfectly lawful. Others held
that there were extenuating circumstances which were not
allowed to appear at the trial. Concerning Leisler himself,
opinions differ just as widely. He has been held up as a
champion of Dutch democracy against English aristocracy,
of Protestantism against Romanism, of republicanism ag^st
monarchism. On the other hand, Broadhead can see no
good in Leisler, and stamps his efforts as ^ the selfish attempt
of an upstart demagogue to obtain a local importance, which
neither his own character nor the circumstances of the
province warranted." In spite of these conflicting opinions,
however, there can be little doubt as to the honesty of
Leisler's purpose. He may have been arbitraiy and tyran-
nical, and the hatred of him may have been vexy well
founded, but to say that he was an upstart demagogue'*
is not at all consonant with the facts in the case. Regarded
in the light of those disturbed months immediately follow-
ing the arrest of Andros and the flight of Nicholson, the
conduct of Leisler may be satisfnrt(&gt;rily explained, if not
altogether condoned. He very naturally assumed that the
deposition of James U. and the accession of William IH.
meant the overthrow of the government of the former in

THE REVOLUtlON OF 1688 305

New York. Consequently, he merely took up the reins
of government where the representatives of James had
dropped them. No doubt, he did so with the intention of

turning them over to the properly accredited representatives
of the new monarchs when they should make their appear-
ance. Leisler's action was most patriotic. He refused to
surrender the fort, because Lieutenant-governor Ingoldshy
had arrived, as we have seen, without any official documents
with which to support his pretensions to the government.
Leisler was naturally suspicious of Ingoldsby's claim, think-
ing it to be the trick of a Stuart refugee to gain possession
of New York. I'he former's willineness to surrender
authority to the officially deputed representatives of the
Protestant monarchs relieves him of the imputation that
he was himself desirous of obtaining possession of the
government. Whatever view we may take of Leisler and
his policy, his execution, as well as'^kdilbome's, was a fright-
ful blunder — impolitic is too weak a word. The attainder
against Leisler and Milborne was reversed by Parliament in
1695. The convictions, moreover, were annulled and the
estates of the two men were restored to their fiimilies.

We must now turn our attention to the condition of
affairs in Maryland that resulted from the overthrow
of James IL Lord Baltimore was visiting in £ngland
when William and Mary ascended the throne, and he was
instructed immediately to proclaim the new sovereigns in
his province. Accordingly, he despatched a messenger to
carry the order to his Council. Unfortunatclv for him, the
messenger died on the v/ay. The proclamation was delayed
long enough to give the proprietor's enemies ample time to
hatch new plots and to vitalize old ones against him. The
Marylanders knew of William's succession, for he had been
proclaimed in Virginia and in New England. The delay
to proclaim him in their province they chose to consider
intentional and to construe as a device on the part of the
Catholics to gain control of the colony. The proprietor's
enemies had for years circulated reports of Romish plots^



3o6 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



and now th&lt;* failurt" of his Catholic government to proclaim
the Protestant king gave them just the opportunity for which
they had been looking.

A second messenger was sent out by Lord Baltimore,
but he reached Maiyland too late to prevent the impending
revolution. Reports of a conspiracy among the Indians,
French, and Catholics to exterminate the Protestants were
now diligently circulated by the malccmtents. Exaggerated
accounts reached the settlers, from different sources, of
attacks being made by an armed force. When investiga*
tion proved the report false in one place, another report
sprang up in a different place. After all rumors were run
down and proved utterly baseless, an uprising for the time
being was prevented.

Ihc peace thus secured w.is only temponiry, however;
for a few months later, in July, trouble broke out anew.
This time the opposition was headed by John Coode, a
captain of militia, assisted bv Blackiston, one of the col-
lectors of customs, and uii unrelenting enemy of Bakiniure.
Others joined them, and together they marched on to
St. Mary's. Here the officers had been able to gather only
a small force, and they were compelled to surrender without
even a show of resistance. The government thus changed
hands without bloodshed.

In the meantime, Coode and his associates had oiganized
themselves into what they called a Protestant Association.
After the suirender of St. Mary's, they set forth in a paper
an explanation of their action. Their sole excuse for taking
up arms was the persistent rumors of Popish plots to anni-
hilate the Protestants. These reports had been proved false,
and there is little doubt but that Coode and Blackiston had
contributed a fair share to their circulation. It is certainly
true that the declaration they issued was signed by men
who had investigated the rumors and had declared them to
be false.

Coode now took the title of General," and promised
his followers high dignities as a reward of merit for their

insurrectionary acts. The Associators were not emphatically
supported, even by all the Protestants. Yet they pro-
clain»eJ William and Mary the new sovereigns. Further-
more, they called an Assembly and hllcd all offices with
Protestants. Then fullowcJ .LdJros after address directed
to \\'i]liani, 111 which all tlic cnniuics save Anne Arundel
declared themselves in sympathy vvith Cuode and his move-
ment. Counter addresses were also sent, discounting the
charges against the proprietary and declaring Coode and his
folkmen a 8et of factious knavet." llie AsfociatofB^
having the approval of William, conducted the afiain of
the government much as they taw fit. Officers were com-
minioned, property was plundered, and all those who should
essay to stay them in the accomplishment of their purposes
were threatened with death.

During the reign of James II., quo warranU proceedings
against the Maryland charter had been in pjog^ss, hut bis
flight from Eng^d practically put an end to the suit. The
charter remained unimpaired and the proceedings were
not resumed. However, William was now anxious to
gain every advantage that would aid him in his fight with
Louis XIV. Consequently, he was by no means loath to
take Maryland under the direct protection of the crown,
when that course was advised by his Cduncil and urged by
the colonists themselves.

The king at first decided to proceed ag^st the chatter
by way of scire faciasi but as this was a very slow and
tedious method for the accomplishment of the object sought.
Chief Justice Holt was requested to render an opinion as to
whether the government of the province could be taken
over in any other way. In June, 1690, the chief justice
gave the following opinion : " I think it had been better if
an inquisition had been taken, and the forttitures com-
mitted by the Lord Baltimore had been therein found before
any grant be made to a new governor. Yet since there is
none, and it being; a case of neccssit\ , I think the kinp; may

by the king was the only means of preserving the province.

however, lost of his territoiul ri^u. Fiom being s free

CHAPTER XIII

THE MIDDLE COf ONIES AFTER THE FUGHT OF
JAMES //., 1692^1714

As IN the case of all revolutions, that of Leisler was
followed bv a period of reaction. Lciisler was called by
certain ut his democratic enemies " Little Cromwell," and
there is much in the appcJIatiun that was not intended by
its authors. There are, indeed, points of similarity between
this New York revolution of 1689 and its great prototype,
the Knghsh Revolution of 1640. Likewise, there are de-
cided points of similarity between the New York reaction
of 1691 and the English reaction under Charles IL in 1660.
Of course, the New York revolution of 1689 was but the
laiiit echo of the English Revolution of 1 688, when James II.
was driven out of England, hut 1688 itself was but the
continuation and consummation of the great revolution
under CromwelL Leisler had all the bigotry of Cromwell
and none of his breadth of character. Both were fiuiat-
ically religious, and both hated the Roman Church. Both
started out hf being democratic and ended by being tjrran*
nicaL They were creations of the times, and the times
demanded such creations. X/dsler lost his life, and Crom«
well did not, but we do not know what would have happened
had the latter lived a decade longer. But to draw a pandld
between Leisler and Cromwell is like comparing a frog pond
to the gnat Atiantic^-one neither shows the importance of
the former nor the greatness of the latter. Leisler had, no

tlouht, some of the characteristics of Cromwell, but only in
miniature. The pumts of resemblance lie rather in the
times than m the men. As in Kiigland in i66o, so in
New York in 1691, a reaction against liberal democracy
set in and an aristocracy that accomplished nothing but
discontent was firmly established in power.

We come now to a period of puppet governors, with but
one or two exceptions. History," says Roberts, ^ often
turns on the character and conduct of the rulers. At this
period New York affords no wide field of that sort. Its
governors moved over the stage almost as rapidly and with
little more substance than the Scottish kings who appeared to
Macbeth. Their terms were more brief than those in other
colonies. While V^tr^-inia had twenty governors in the
century before the Revolution, Massachusetts twenty-one,
and Pennsylvania twenty-five, the executive authority in
New York underwent thirty-three changes, counting the
lieutenant-governors servine temporarily as heads of the gov-
ernment." After the execution of Leisler, New Yoric was
in a most critical condition. It was rent by internal fac-
tions and threatened by foreign warfare. I^ouis XIV. was
fully bent upon the chastisement, if not indeed the con-
quest, of the people who in alliance with the Five Nations
had made desolate his Canadian territory. Everything that
French ingenuity and cunning could suggest was employed
to induce the Iroquois to break with their English allies.

Sloughter went to Albany on May 26, 169 1, to negotiate
with the Mohawks for the purpose of counteracting the
influence brought to bear upon them by the French. The
troubles of the T.eislerian period had well-niyih caused the
loss of the sympathy and alleginnrp of the friendly Iroquois,
for the wily PVenchman had employed his time to the greatest
possible advantage. No time was to be lost, and Sloughter
appreciated this fact. On his arrival at Albany, he found
the Mohawks waiting for him. Mayor Schuyler, of Albany,
and Robert Livingston managed the negotiations. The
former had brought gifts from England, and these were

presented to the Indians with the pomp and ceremony sug-
gestive of a much more formidable list of valuables than
die following: one dozen stockings, six shirts, three hags
of powder, sixteen bars of lead, thirty strings of wampum,
three runlets of rum, three rolls of tobacco, and some coats
of duffels to the "chief on the sly."

To restore the confidence of the Indians, an aggressive
campaign into Canada was decided upon. Mayor Schuvler
was put in command of the expedition and left Albany on
the 2 Tst of June with four hundred men. Five-sixths of
the sc were Indians. The expedition, though gallantly con-
dui ted, met with only negative success, save that it stimu-
lated the Iroquois to further aggressive efforts against the
French.

When the expedition left Albany, Sloughtcr left also —
but 111 the opposite direction. While the valiant Schuyler
and his forces were fighting the French and Indians,
Sioughter no doubt was making vigorous and repeated as-
saults upon his rum barrels. In this he excelled, for in the
midsummer of 1691 he died in the agonies of a complaint
resembling delirium tremens.

Chief Justice Dudley, the person to assume control of
affairs in an emef]^c7 of thb kind, was in Cura^oa, and
the Council declared Ingoldsby commander-in-chief until
the king's pleasure should be known. About the only good
accompHshed by Sioughter was the establishment upon a
firm foundation of a representative body. The first thing
he did after the arrest of Leisler, in fact, was to issue writs
for the election of an Assembly. It was made up of the
pronounced opponents of Leisler — of the party of aristo-
crats. It met in a tavern on Pearl Street, on the 9th of
April, 1691, and marked the beginning of "continuous con-
stitutional government in New York.'*

Ingoldsby*s characterless rule was to last but little over
a year and a month. In response to a request for
help against the French and Indians, William appointed
Colonel Benjamin Fletcher governor. Fletcher arrived on

August 29, 1692, and was given a brilliant reception that
cost £2o\ The new goveraor was a ** soldier of fortune,"
zealous and energetic, but very avaricious and wholly unfit
to rule a province. One of his first acts was to make a trip

to Albany. He spent weeks as the guest of Peter Schuyler
and with him made a trip into the Mohawk country, where
he was entertained bv the Indians m their famous castles.
T hey called him the Great Swift Arrow." He pried into
their character, habits, and strength, and learned something
of their language. The Indians called Schuyler the " Great
Brave White Chief," and well they might, for he was easily
the equal of Frontcnac in his skill in dealing with the red
men. To Peter Schuyler more than to any other man is
due the cementing of the Iroquois friendship.

Fletcher soon found that the bed of a governor was
not one of roses. The Leislerians and the anti-Leislerians
— the democrats and the aristocrats — ^fought continually.
They lost sight of the commonweal in the intensity of
their petty bickerings. Then, again, Fletcher demanded
some very doubtful things: first, he wanted to establish the
Protestant Epttcopal Church and support it from the reve-
nues ; and secondly, to get the revenue voted for the lifetime
of the reigning king. Matters reached a crisis on a revenue
bill that had been amended by the governor and supported
by the Council. The Assembly voted it down and passed
the original bill. This exasperated Fletcher so much that he
took it upon himself to rebuke the Assembly, after which
he immediately declared it prorogued. He described the
people of New York as "divided, contentious, and im-
poverished." Hy his opposition he drove them into a still
more stubborn resistant e to his plans.

William added to Fletcher's burdens by revoking in 1693
the proprietary grants of Pennsylvania and Delaware to
William Penn and adding them to New York. The Jer-
seys and the Connecticut militia had already been put under
his control. Immediately after his appointment, Fletcher
summoned the Pennsylvania Assembly and required all its

mcflnben to take the oeths piescribed by P^iament. He
utterly disregarded the quarrels between the Upper and
Lower Counties^ and summoned representatives of both.
As in the case of the New York Assembly, Fletcher fe»
quested that of Pennsylvania to pass measures for the de-
fence of the Canadian ftonticr. But the Quakers were
totally opposed to granting war supplies, and the new gov-
ernor at once came into conflict widi their Assembly. After
repeated and unsuccessful attempts to secure a war gnuit,
in which he firat threatened and then cajoled the Quaken,
Fletcher was compelled to acknowledge himself thoroughly
outwitted and beaten. He dissolved the Assembly and re-
turned to New York. The additional load of Pennsyl-
vania was too much for Fletcher's weak backhand he prayed
the king to relieve him. His request was granted in the
following year.

Penn, who had been deprived of his province for nearly
two years, now prepared a petition to the king, praying to
be reinstated in his rights. The petition was referred to the
Privy Council, which, after having made a thorough exami-
nation of the case and finding nothing against the petitioner,
recommended the restoration of the province. Penn now
Hcrame a man of influence at court. He appointed Mark-
ham as his deputy, who was to be assisted by Samuel Car-
penter and John Gondson. In i 700, Pcnn himself visited
the cnlonv, but his brief stay of two ^cars was not very
a&lt;rrc('aMc to him. There was constant tnction between
the A.sscnil^lv and himself on the issue of mom y grants
for the detence of the northern frontier. Furthermore,
the Assembly was so pertinacious in its demands for a new
charter that Penn finally gave a reluctant consent.

1 his new charter consisted of nine articles, ihv first of
which dealt with religious liberty. Fletcher and Markham
had required ail ollicc holders tu subscribe to the English
Toleration Act of 1689, Penn was broader-minded.
Xhis first article of the new charter accorded the Catholics
the privilege of holding office. The king, however, did not

MIDDLE STJTBS JND MARTUND



sustain Penn in the matter, and required the Pennsylvania

Assembly to enforce the Act. Consequently, Catholics,
Jews, and " imhflievers" were shut out from office until the
American Rcvoluticm. The second article of the charter
granted a larger representation from the counties, made the
Assembly an entirely independent legislative body, and took,
away from the Council the legislative powers that it had
enjoyed. Certain articles provided for local government.
The last article declared the charter void should its provisions
be vioUited hy Penn or any of his heirs.

At this time Pennsylvania politics assumed a triangular
chancter* The three parties in the iield were the Proprie-
tarjTf Churchman, and Lloyd. The last-mentioned party
was, in many respects, the most unique. At its head stood
David Lloyd, formerly a Welsh lawyer and a captain in
Cromwell's army. He was a man of g^t ability, but ob-
stinate and revengeful. He became a member of the Pro-
vincial Council, and in t686 wns appointed attorney-genera!
hy William Penn. For thirty years Lloyd was a prominent
tiL^Lirc in the Assembly, and many of the laws of Welsh
colonng passed by that body were due to his inriuence. On
the other hand, his obstinacy caused the defeat of many
salutary laws and measures. At first a friend of the pro-
prietor, he later became the leader of the party that bitterly
opposed all measures of the administration. On Penn's
departure for Engknd, Andrew Hamilton, who had been
Governor of East Jersey, was appointed Governor of Penn-
sylvania. Hamilton shortly afterward died, and John Evans,
a Welshman, was appointed in his place. James Logan
, became provincial secretary. Logan was a shrewd poli-
tician and a faithful supporter of the proprietary. From his
boyhood he had paid much attention to scientific studies,
and he, David Rittenhouse the astronomer, John Bartram
and his son William the botanists, Thomas Godfrey, who
shared with John Hadlcy the honor of inventing an im-
proved quadrant, and Benjamin Franklin stand foremost
among the scientists of Pennsylvania's early history.

AFTER THE FUGHT OF JAMES Jl 315

Lloyd began to be ;t power in Pennsylvania politics about
1704. The administration greatly dreaded his ascendency
aiul used every eliort to check his rise in power, but with-
out success. A very good idea of his character as judged
by the administration may be had from the following letter
of James Logan to William Penn, under date of 1 704 :
**THvid Llojd being recorder of the city and likely in all
protmbility to be speaker of the next Assembly, from his
temper, so weU known, there seems but little good to be
anticipated* The generality, however, are honestly and well
inclined and out of the Assembly are very good men, but
when got together, I know not how, they are infatuated and
led by smooth stories* David himself makes as great a pro-
fession as any man, but we can sec no good effects from it."

Lloyd was made speaker of the Assembly of 1704, and
immediately set about attacking the proprietor and Governor
Evans. In the Assembly of 1705, he probably had a hand
in defeating revenue bills and urgent measures in the inter-
est of the proprietor. In this opposition his hands were
untioubtctlly strengthened bv the unpupulantv which the
Proprietary pait\' had mcuncd by reason of its attempt to
levy an impost on cunmierce. Nor was that unpopularity
lessened by the childish insistence on the part of the admin-
istrstion officials upon minor and petty matters of official
etiquette. The following instance is in point and will suf-
fice as a typical example of other instances* Upon one
occasion, Lloyd neglected to rise while speaking. The
governor commanded him to stand, but Lloyd refused point-
blank, claiming to be exempted from this tribute of respect
in conference where equality was indispensable and was
sanctioned by precedent." Lloyd claimed to represent the
people, but ina«;m!!ch as the governor claimed to represent
the queen the latter doggedly insisted on his point, l^he
House, " fearin^r the difference mi^ht terminate in unseemly
language,** u ithdrew in a body.

One of Lloyd's most powerful antagonists was James
Logan. Lloyd was not so learned as Logan, but was far



Digitized by Google



3l6 MWDIE STATES AND MARYLAND



more pleasing in his manner. Besides, he was skilful in
debate, and championed popular rights. TJoyd and his
party accused Logan of trying to deprive the people ot their
rights, and articles of impeachment were drawn up, but they
failed in their issue. Governor Evans was next attacked for
his immoral conduct. Unfortunately, most of the accusa-
tions were true, and it was necessary for Penn to admonish
his representative before the latter mended his ways.

The admuHstratiun next attempted to turn the tables upon
Lloyd, who had just been reelected speaker of the Assem-
bly of 1 709. This time, i^ugan, through Governor Charles
Gookin, the successor of Evans, preferred char]ges ag^st
Lloyd for certain alleged misdemeanors. But the charges
were examined into and declared false. Matters finally
came to a crisis when Logan was arrested by order of the
Assembly, but was released by the governor on the ground
that the Assembly had no authority to make arrests outside
its own body. Later, Lc^an went to London, where he
favorably presented his case to the proprietary. These
petty disputes so vexed Penn that he threatened to sell out
to the government unless the Assembly showed a disposi-
tion to improve. The people then redized their danger,
and in the following election not a single member of the
old Assembly was returned, not even Lloyd. This Assem-
b!v, without Lloyd, it is said, "ceased to ]i\e on quarrels."
Nevertheless, Lloyd was returned by the voters soon after,
and was even elected speaker, but it was as a chastened
man. His defeat had taught him the emptiness of popu-
larity. He ever afterward worked in the interests of the
public, and after his death, when critical measures came
up before the Assembly, that body felt deeply the loss of
Lloyd's wise counsels.

The Lower Counties or " 1 crritories" on the Delaware
had never worked harmoniously with the main province
of Pennsylvania. At this time the Territories and the
main province each comprised three counties. To preserve
the balance of power between the two sections, each had

I



AFTER tHM fUGHT OF JAMES IL 317

an equal number of representatives in the Council. Inas-
much as the latter was much larirer than the former, the
political balance couid not be mamtained much longer.
Disagreement between the two territorial divisions dates
from almost the time when the 'I'erritories came into the
possession of Pcnn — 1685. Thenceforward, the trouble
continued to grow more acute, until linally the six j^iembers
of the Council from the Territories proceeded to apjx iat and
commission justices without the concurrence o( the whole
Council or of its president, Thomas Lloyd. The Council
protested in 1690 against these unconstitutional measures,
but tlw members from the Territories not only paid no
attention whatever to its protests but even took further
arbitrary steps.

The Territories continued to be jealous of the province^
and matters did not mend. For purposes of concifiation,
October 14, 1700, Penn convened the Assembly at New
Casde. In his address to the Assembly the proprietor
ttfged amity and concord between the two contesting fac-
tions, but widiout the destfed result. The members from
the Territories claimed the rig^t to withdraw ftom the As-
sembly when they pleased, and even refused to recognize
the authority of the proprietary unless a mutual understand-
ing was arranged. They admitted that the crown had the
ti^t to establ^ a form of government, but specifically de-
manded an equal representation in the Geneial Assembly.
If this were not accorded them, they saw that the rapid
growth of the province would soon put them in the minority.
If an equal representation could not be secured, the recal-
citrant members believed the Territories would fare better
under a separate government. Nevertheless, the plan of
equal representation was rejected by Penn and the province.

An agreement was finally reached, by which no law of
interest to the Territories was to be enartrd unless by a
vote of two-thirds of the members fnm the IVrritnries
and of a majuritv f&gt;f the nu nihrr^ fmm the province. It was
likewise agreed that the latter should pay £^^TS and the

jl8 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



former £\2S for the support of the proprietor and the gov-
ernor. Furthermore, by another Assembly the Territories
were permitted to dissolve their union within three years
from the date, of the new charter, if they so desired.

This agreement did not settle the dispute, for after the
departure of Penn to England trouble again developed.
The representatives of the Territories refused to meet in
an Assembly with those of the province. They also re-
fused to accept the new charter, which had been signed by
Penn on October 25, 1701. It was the turn of the prov-
ince now to ask to be relieved from political union with
such cantankerous counties. Governor Andrew Hamilton
tried his best to preserve the union, but the province was
firm in its demand for separation. The final separation
occurred in October, 1 702, when Pennsylvania convened
its legislature apart from the Territories. The two colonies
were never again united, and the Lower Counties became
almost an independent republic. They were not included
in the charter, and the executive power of the Governor of
Pennsylvania over them was too feeble to restrain them.
The proprietors of both Pennsylvania and Maryland claimed
jurisdiction over the Lower Counties, and between the two
disputes the foundation for the sovereign State of Delaware
was established.

An important law regulating suffirage was passed during
the administration of Governor John Evans. Qualified
voters had to be the owners of fifty acres of land or pos-
sessed of 50 in money. No person could vote unless
bom or naturalized in En^and or in the province. Resi«
dence in the province for two years before the election
was likewise required. The sale or purchase of votes was
punished by a fine and loss of the right of suffrage for a
period of time. Penalties were likewise provided for other
electoral irregularities. Each county was accorded eight
representatives, while Philadelphia was given two.

The matter of war grants probablv gave the provincial
governors of Pennsylvania more trouble than anything else.

Queen Anne made a requisition upon the Assembly for
one hundred and fifty men, besides officers, for the expedi-
tion against Canada. Governor Gookin knew the consci-
entious scruples of the Quakers against war grants, and
proposed that a gnmt of ;^4,ooo for the support of the
government be nude. The matter was taken under con-
sideration, and an attempt at a compromise is shown in the
followti^ reply of the Assembly: ^the raising of money to
hire men to %ht (or kill one another) was a matter of con-
science to diem, and ag^unst their principles": but not to
iq&gt;pear disloyal they would appropriate j^soa as a present
to the queen. The governor objected to the smallness of
the amount, and refused to pass several bills until the
gnuit was increased. Not until the next Assembly was
the sum raised to £xfiQOy and then only in the form of
a pcesent to the queen. The composition of this Assembly
was completely different from the preceding one. It worked
harmoniously with the governor and attended strictly to
business. A better and ampler revenue system was estal^
lished, the revenue came into the treasury with greater
regularity, and there was less bickering and quarrelling be-
tween rival political factions. The harmony between the
executive and the Assembly was due in no small degree
to Gookin himself. He had learned the value of docility
toward the legislators, and by yielding to many of their
whims secured at least an outward harmony.

In New York, Governor Fletcher nnd his Asscmhly con-
tinued to quarrel, until the Leislerians, through tact and
diplomacy, brought about his recall. They accused Fletcher
of at least receiving bribes or hush moiiev from pirates, if
not, indeed, — as sonic asserted, — of being in complicity
with them. It is difficult to say how much truth there was
in their accusations, if, in fact, there was any. i^iracy
had luii^ In en in existence, and was even encouraged rather
than otherwise by ihc Kuropean governments. During; the
time of war, armed private vessels, with or without licenses,
roved the i&gt;c&lt;u&gt; and plundered almost at pleasure. They did

not scop with preying upon the enemy's commerce, but
soon turned their attention to the commerce of neutrals
or even to thait of their countrymen itself. In so far as

Fletcher was concerned, the Leislerians saw their chance to
bring about his downfall by connecting him with these
piracies, and were not slow in grasping the opportunity.
Fletcher always resented the charges most indignantly, and,

it must be said, they were never really proved.

It is true, he had issued commissions for sea captains to
raise men and equip privateers against the French, but this
was m line with the common practice in England. He had
probably accepted bribes and had pruiiused protection, but
not to Icnown pirates. Nevertheless, commissions were
found in the possession of sea robbers like Coates, Hoare,
1 ew, and others, that seemed to implicate the governor in
their crimes, lie nij.iniained that they had turned pirates
after receiving their commissions as privateers, with the
exception of Tew, who had promised not to engage in
piracy again. Tew was an agreeable and companionable
fellow, whom he had often entertuned at his table and had
taken to drive. He wished to convert the former pirate
from the terror of his ways and especially to cure him of
the vile habit of swearing.'' With diis end in view, he had
presented him with a book on the subject and had made him
a present of a gun of some value. Tew, in return, the
governor said, had presented him with a curious watch. It
was also claimed that he had presented Mrs. Fletcher and
her daughters with valuable jewels. Tew shortly afterward
showed to what extent he had been converted from the
error of bis ways through the governor's missionary zeal
by proceeding to the Indian Ocean and harboring himself
with others of his kind among the creeks of Madagascar.
Here he "plundered and murdered untii humanity," says
Mrs. Lamb, " refuses to blot the pages of history with his
deeds." Fletcher was not the only citizen of New York
implicated in piracy. Some of the wealthiest and hitherto
most respectable citizens were likewise accused of prohting

hy the spoils. The remarkable incieaae in the number of
stiangers in the ctty^ the sale of the richest oriental goods,
the unusual circulation of the gold coins of the East, not to
speak of the rapidity with which expensive buildings were
erected, all pointed to illicit and unusual sources of wealth.

It mattered little whether the charges made against
Fletcher by his enemies were true or fake, they had suffi-
cient foundation in circumstances to bring about his recall.
We must recollect in his defence that he had not lived in
peace with his l^g^tive Assembly, and it is altogether likelj
that this fact may have lent strength to the accusations
against him. The Assembly did not support him in his
endeavors to secure an established ministry, a revenue for
the king during life, repairs for the fort, and the erection of
a chapel. One act of Fletcher's, however, must not be
passed over in silence. In his zeal for the good of a State
church, he had built a small chapel in the fort in 1693,
which the queen sent plates, books, and other furniture. It
was burned with the other buildings in 1741, and but httle
is known of its history. One church, however, of his
creation remains a monument to his administration to this
day. Fletcher granted what was known as the King's }• arm
to Protestant Episcopal churchwardens for the site of a new
edifice. A building was at once projected, and in course
of a few oiojiths was completed. A charter, bearing date
May 6, 1697, ^^^^ granted by an Act of Assembly, approved
and ratified by the governor and Council. This w;is IVin-
ity Church, ihc fuuiidatioii oi the vastly rich and powerful
Tritiit\' piirish of to-dav.

Richard Coote, Earl of Bcllomont, the new governor,
though appointed in June, 1697, ^'^ '^^^ arrive in New
York until April 2, 1698. His coming was a great event
in the colony. He was greeted hj a committee of promi-
nent citizens from both political parties and crowds of
people. Four barrels of gunpowder were burned in the
salute of welcome, and a pretentious dinner was served in
his honor. Bellomont was to serve likewise as Governor



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAHD



of Masfachusctts and New Hampshire. He had been
created earl by William in recognition of his services as
treasurer and receiver-general of Maiy and as the confidential
friend of the king. He was a man of pure life and strict
honor, and much above the average type of the colonial gov-
ernor. He belonged to the aristocracy of £ngland, yet
believed in popular liberty and was not averse to political
equality. He frequently championed the cause of the com-
tnon people, and thus won the enmity of the aristocratic
clement of the colony. Largely for this reason his adminis-
tration proved to be a stormy one. In addition, he had to
contend with political corruption amunir public officials.

immediately upuii his arrival, Bellomont took up the cause
of the Leislehans. He had the body of Leisler buried again
with honor, and restored the estates of Leisler and Milborne
to tlieir tanulicb. I his caused trouble, for many innocent
persons had bought up parts of these estates. The new
governor attacked land grants and even proposed bills pre-
vendi^ anyone from owning over one thousand acres of
land. He ousted the Bayards, who were accused of com-
plicity with the pirates, and appointed Leislerians in their
places.

In the election of 1699 the aristocracy was completely
defeated, and the Leislerians secured all the offices. This
caused somewhat of a panic, for the rumor was spread
broadcast that an attempt would be made by the Leislerians
to get compensation for the property they had lost several
years before. In 1700, just prior to the death of Bellomont,
an act was passed favorable to the claims of the Leislerians.
The aristocracy thereupon petitioned the crown. Charges
of treason were then brought against Bayard, and a packed
jur)' found him guilty. He, with Hutchings, was sentenced
to be disembowelled and quartered, while others in the •
so-called treason suffered confiscation of estates. However,
upon the arrival of Lord Cornbury, the new governor,
May 3, 1702, Bavard and Hutchings were liberated and
their lands restored to them. The Leisler Act was repealed,

and the policy of neutrality adopted by the new governor
very much allayed the ill feelings between the contesting

factions.

For years piracv had been imperceptibly growing. It
readied its height after England and Holland put an end to
Spain's supremacy. Privateering against Spanish-American
commerce had the air of respectability, but it soon degener-
ated into piracy. Then, again, tariff regulations had much
to do with fostering the practice, for the people were eager
to purchase goods horn the pir^ites on account of the low
price for which they were sold. Another cause of the re-
markable growth of piracy during the seventeenth century
was undoubtedly the more rapid expansion of commerce
than the growth of naval facilities for protecting it. The
chief haunts of the puates were in the Indian Ocean, oiF
the coast of Madagascar. Frequently, however, they would
bring their stolen goods to New York and swear they had
captured them from the French. Then, again. New York
merchantmen would meet them at Madagascar and trade
rum for their gold and East India goods. Filially, the
trade prospered to such a degree that it became difficult
to suppress it.

Chief among those engaged in this unlawful trade was
Captain Kidd, a cultivated and attractive manner, and an
honest man during the early part of his life. He is said to
have hccn the son of a Presbyterian minister in Scotland,
and frequently styled himself " gentleman." In 1691 Kidd
received an award of 150 from the Council of New York
for services he had rendered the colony.

The pirates became so arrogant that the king determined
to suppress them, and with this object in view a naval force
was httcd uut to be sent to the eastern seas. Kidd was
recommended for the captaincy of one of the ships, and he,
Robert Livingston, and Lord Bellomont entered into a
private partnership to put down piracy. They subscribed
£6^000 among themselves, and Kidd was given letters of
marque, authorizing him to capture French vessels. Ten

per cent of the proceeds was to be given to the king, the
rest to be divided among the three partners. Kidd left New
York for Mads^scar in 1697. Nothing was heard of him
for some time, until the rumor came that he himself had
turned pirate. Such a report placed Bellomont in a pre-
carious position, a fact of which his enemies were not slow
in taking advants^. Shortly afterward, Bellomont received
a message from Kidd, sajring he had returned to Narra-
g^sett Bay and had prizes to the amount of lopoo on
board. He denied he had ever turned pirate.

How Kidd is supposed to have become a pirate is one of
the most interesting, though perplexing, historical romances
that the histoiy of New York presents. Let us follow his
career in the eastern seas for a brief space, for about it
centres the history of the colony for almost a decade. In
fact, the reputation of Bellomont and of Robert Living-
ston suffered considerably by reason of their intimacy with
Kidd. The politics of the colony and even of England
were tainted with the suspicion that those high in authority
were in league, not only with Kidd, but with all the promi-
nent pirates and privateers, buccaneers and maroons, of that
piratical age.

Captain Kidd was furnished with two commissions: first,
letters of marque and reprisal, authorizing him to capture
French vessels — England being at that time at war with
France J secondly, special commission for the arrest of pirates,
confiscation of their property, and for bringing them to trial.
With these two commissions he sailed out of Plymouth for
New York, May, 1 696, in the Adventure^ a galley of thirty-
six guns and eighty men. After increasing his company to
one hundred and fifty-five men and taking on additicmal
stores at New York, he sailed at first for Madeira, and after
his departure from there the civilized world saw nothing of
him for more than two years. He reached Madagascar in
February, 1697, j"^ ^^^'^ months from his sailing from
Plymouth. Finding no pirates in those parts, he tried his
fortunes on the coast of Malabar. His provisions were

every day wasting, and his ship beg^ui to need repairs very

seriously.

At first it docs not appear that he had the least design of
turning pirate. His first depredation was at a place called
Mabber, on the Red Sea, where he took some "Guinea
corn" from the natives by force. After this he is said to
have acceded to his starving crew's demands to turn pirate.
Happening to talk of the Mocha fleet, it is claimed he said:
*'We have been unsuccessful hitherto; but courage, my
boys, we'll make our fortunes out of this fleet." Si)un the
fleet appeared, convoyed by one English and one Dutch
man-of-war. This he attacked, though without success.
One attack led to another, until he and his crew impercepti-
bly took up the life of pirates. However, for a while they
confined themselves to attacking the vessels of the heathen,
but afterward those of Christian nations were likewise
attacked.

The Advtntwre proving old and leaky, Kidd transferred
his goods to a captured Moorish merchantman, the ^utda^
but lost all except forty of his men — some going with the
Resobaion^ another pirate ship, ^d others deserting. He
next touched at Amboyna, one of the Dutch spice islands,
where he received the unwelcome intelligence that he had
become notorious in £ngland and had been declared a
pirate. His piracies, in fact, had so alarmed the English
merchants that a motion passed Parliament to inquire into
his commission and to discover the persons who had fitted
him out.

In the tneantime, a royal proclamation was issued grant-
ing pardon to all pirates who would surrender themselves.
Kidd and another pirate, Avery, were excepted. This was to
throw ofF all suspicion that his partners, well-known in Eng-
lish and American politics at that time, might incur. The
Tories exaggerated Kid*J's deeds for the purpose of under-
mining the influence of the Lord Chancellor, who was a
Whig. When ICidd left Amboyna he knew nothing of
this prodamation, otherwise he would surely never have



326 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



sailed right into the jaws of danger. He relied upon his
interest with Lord Bellomont, the showing of a French
pass or two found on board ships he had captured, and a
division of the rich booty he had secured, to hush the matter
up and to ensure that justice would but wink at him.

Kidd had, however, made an enemy of the one man of
whose friendship he stood most in need. Bellomont may
have had his shortcomings, but they were not in the direc-
tion of a lack of zeal for the public good. Then, again,
Kidd had wounded his pride — ^for the governor had a very
keen sense of hit own honor. Kidd had been sent out
for the special purpose of clearing the American coast of
pirates^ but had turned pirate himself. Bellomont was eager
for revenge.

In the meantime, .Kidd had bought a small sloop at the
island of Cura9oa, in which he put his spoils of immense

value. He left the ^eda at Santo Domingo and proceeded
to New York. There he learned that the governor had
gone to Boston. Kidd was joined by his wife and children
at Block Island. At Narragansett Bay, he sent the mes-
sage to Bellomont informing him of his arrival with goods
worth 0,000. He declared himself entirely innocent of
the acts of piracy with which he had been charged. Bello-
mont, in rcpiv, promised him protection if he could establish
his innocence. Accordingly, on July ist, Kidd landed in
Boston, made the governor's wife a present of jewels, and
recited his story. The governor not bcmg satisfied with it,
Kidd was arrested a few days later and finally was sent to
London. Here he was imprisoned more than a year, while
evidence was being collected against him in the East Indies.

Kidd was tried in May, 1 701, at the Sessions of Admi-
ralty held at the Old Bailey, on the two charges of piracy
on the high seas and the murder of one William Moore, a
gunner. When Kidd was asked what he had to say why
sentence should not be passed against him, he answered
that *^ht had nothing to say, but that he had been sworn
against by peijured, wicked people." When sentence was

For my part, I am the innocentest person of them all [refer-
ring to other pirates on trial, tome of whom had been tc*
quitted] , only I have heen twom against by perjured penont.''
On May 12, 1701, Captain Kidd and lix omn weie ex^
cttted at Emcutbn Dock. Their bodies weie bung in
chains, at intervals down the river, and there exposed for
sevend 3pears. The verdict was undoubtedly predetermined %
but a few jears before, Ridd's exploits would have been ap-
plauded lather than condemned, ^ Under ofdinary circum-
stances," says Doyle, &lt;«Kidd, instead of becoming an ogie
of legend, might have ended bis days as a re s p e cted citizen,
and his bones, instead of bleaching on a gibbet, might have
rested under a stone where he would be described as an
exemplary husband and father, a biave seaman, and a pious
Christian.'*

We must turn our attention now to afiairs in the Jerseys.
In the spring of 1692 the proprietors had appointed Colo-
nel Andrew Hamilton Governor of West Jersey, where he
arrived in September of the same year. His pcrs&lt;»ial popu-
larity led the people to accept the resumption of a proprietary
form of government without complaint. The Assembly
was convened on September 28th, at Perth Amboy, and all
laws passed subsequent to t 682, with but few exceptions,
were either reenacted or anunded. Tn addition, n war grant
was made to assist New York m deteoding her frontiers
against French and Indian invasion. A similar irrnnt was
refused in 1696, unless New York were actually invaded.
Later, legislation was passed to improve foreign trade, to
regulate the courts, ami to construct better roads.

With an increase in pupulaiion and the growth of settle-
ments, the people of East Jersey began to feel pressing
need of more schouls and schoolmasters. The first action
of importance in East Jersey in this direction was in 1693.
In the records of a meeting of the Council held at Perth
Amboy, October 20, 1 693, we find the following : " A

house, one Intitled for seding a School and School Master
in evety town in and throughout ye province, the other a
bill for regdation of ordinaries/' In fSM:t, the records of
the period are replete with evidence of the determination
of the people to establish a suitable school system.

By an Act of Parliament in 1697, proprietaries were
compelled to submit the names of their appointees to gov-
ernorships to the king for approval. Inasmuch as no one
but native-bom £nglishmen could hold such offices under
this act. Governor HamUton was ineligible, being a Scotch-
man. Accordingly, he was dismissed on October 1 2, 1697,
and Jeremiah Basse was put in his place. Thoufrh com-
missioned on July 15, 1697, the latter did not arrive until
the spring of 1698. Dissatisfaction with him immediately
developed, and West Jersey refused to recognize him. The
dissatisfaction with Basse grew more and more pronoLinced,
until in August, 1699, the authorities were compelled to
dismiss him and reinstate Hamilton, This was made pos-
sible through the opinion of the king's attornev-gencial and
solicitor-general that a jiative of Scotland was eligible as
governor of a province. He retained the position for but
a short time. Opposition developed against him, in turn,
and Andrew Bowne was commissioned in his place. He,
likewise, was not recognized. As a matter of fact, the*
Jerseys poliucally were in a state bordering on anarchy.
The proprietors had become scattered throughout England,
Scotland, and America. For years they had received but
little proceeds or emoluments from the province. Con-
flicting reports soon came before the crown of the condi-
tion of affairs in the Jerseys, and the final result was a
surrender of the patents of both East and West Jersey to
the crown.

Negotiations leading to this event lasted from July, 1699,
to August, 1702. On August 17, 1702, Queen Anne ac-
cepted the surrender of the two charters. The surrender
was absolute, with the exception of a retention by the
proprietors of certain land privileges, such as quitreots.

At the tame time, the distinctioii between Eait and West
Jeraejr ceased, and the two were united and placed under
the governorship of Edward Hyde, Loid Cdmhuiy, the
newly commissioned Governor of New York. In her in-
structions to Loid Cofnbury, Queen Anne established a
General Assembly for the consolidated Jerrys. It was to
sit alternately first at Perth Amboy in "Sml Jeney and then
at Burlington in We^ Jersey. Combury's commission was
dated July 25, 1702. There were one hundred and three
articles in his instructions, one of which gnnted liberty of
conscience to all except Papists.

In New York, the death of Governor Beikmiont in 170 1
threw matters into confusion. The sadness occasioned by
his death was more than counteracted by the clash of polit-
ical interests that followed immediately. There was no one
on the spot who had a clear constitutional right to succeed
the dead governor. In this lay the danger. There were a
number of claimants, but upon none of these conM those
in 2uthoriiv ■.vjrcc. Lieutenant-governor Nanfaii, who, ac-
cordiiiL; to tlu' charter, should have taken up the reins of
government immediately upon the decease of his sitpLrior,
was in Barbadoes, Colonel William Smith, the senior
member of the Council, was away, but hastened to New
York immediately upon hearing the news.

For over a year New York was in a sute of continuous
political turmoil, lint events, in the meantime, were moving
in kak'idoscopic fashion. William III. died, March 8, 1 702,
alter a reign of over thirteen years, and was succeeded by
Anne, the younger dauL:htcr of James II. Two months
after. May 3d, Lord Coinbiiiy landed at New York, with
considerable ceremony, as governor of the province. The
usual banquet was served. The new governor was a first
cousin of the queen, and had been appointed governor by
William. He had been engaged in militaiy aliairs for nearly
twenty years, hut of political power he had little or no con-
ception. Of tact and discretion he had none, nor did he
have any sympathy with the idea of popular. rt^ts.

In the late autumn of 1703, Cornbury met the New
Jeney Assembly at Perth Amboy. He explained the con-
stitution and stated his purposes to the Council and Assem-
bly. He then demanded a revenue for the government.
The Assembly thanked him for his kind expressions, but
refused to comply wirh his demands with reference to the
revenue. The governor thereupon prorogued the Assembly,
declaring that it would not legislate for the good of the
pr()\ incc. Practically the same farce was repeated the next
year, when the Assembly met at Burlington. This time,
however, the governor demanded an appropriation for the
defence of the province. He bad already asked for ;^2,ooo
per annum for twenty y^un to defray the current expenses
of the government. The Assembly agreed to g^t but
j(i,300 per annum for three years, and was forthwith dis-
solved for its contumacy. By having three of the new
representatives who opposed him rejected, Cornbury secured
a more pliant Assembly in November of the same year.
The ^2^000 was voted, a militia established, and the rigjhts
of suffrage granted to all freeholders.

Tlv arro{Tance and extravagance, Cornbury found him-
self m difficulties not only wnth the New Jersey Assembly
but likewise with that of New York. The former in 1707,
under the leadership of Samuel Jennmgs as speaker, resolved
itself ifiLo a committee of the whole and [i( cidcd to lay its
grievances before the queen. Jennings read these grievances
to the governor, in spite of the latter's frequent interrup-
tions. In New York he had become thoroughly discredited
by reason of his attempt to establish the Protestant £pis-
copal Church in that province to the exclusion of all other
denominations.

Protests against his administration in both provinces
continued to be received by the government in £ngland in
such numbers that his fitness for his position was seriously
discussed by the authorities. The people of New Jersey and
New York were disappointed in him. They were attracted
at first by his rather handsome face and courteous manners.

but they soon experienced his inefficiency. He bore a
striking resemblance to his cousin, Queen Anne, and made
himself ridiculous by bedecking himself with magnificent
and costly millinery, like a lady of the court. When these
petitions for his removal came in rapid succession and were
supported in every instance by the signatures of men of
character and influence throughout the two colonies, the
government acted with commendable promp-tness. Baron
Lovelace of Hurley was appointed in his place, and arrived
at New York on the i8th of December, 1708.

In the midst of the festivities occasioned by the event of
the arrival of the new governor, Cornhury was seized by
his numerous hungry creditors and lotigcd in the debtor*s
prison. Here he was confined until he became Karl of
Clarendon through his father's death. He ihen paid his
debts and left New York, with few friends, if any, to mourn
his departure, "He carried with him to England," says
Lamb, "the memorable distinction of having been one of
the most disreputable of all the New York governors." The
new governor fell ill shortly after his arrival, and died in
the following May. He was succeeded temporarily by
Lieutenant-governor Ingoldsby, who appeared not to have
the confidence of anyone.

In New Jersey, Ingoldsby's brief rule was characterized
by the emission of ;^3,ooo in bills of credit to maintain an
expedition against Canada, under Colonels Nicholson and
Vetch. Three bills were prepared: first, one for raising
;^3,ooo J secondly, one to enforce its currency ; thirdly, to
encourage volunteers to goon the expedition against Canada.
As a result of the second bill, paper currency made its ap-
pearance in New Jersey. The legislature took care in this,
as well as in all the succeedmg emissions, to establish a sink-
ing fund to provide for its ultimate withdrawal. New bills
were to be substituted as the old ones became ragged and
torn, and no reemissions on any account whatsoever were
to be permitted. This issuance of paper mt)iie\' was un-
doubtedly a very unwise step, in spite vt the precautions

taken by the legislature against inflation. It was, in fact,
but a few yean before (June i8, 1704) that Queen Anne
had issued her famous prochimation regulating the value of
coins. The colonial governments met in New York for
the purpose of making elective Anne's \skw. The values
of all coins in circulation were iixed, and there were hopes
that a stable monetaiy system would be the result. Such
was not the case, however ; money grew even scarcer, and
the colonies resorted to paper currency.

Ingoldsby was succeeded by Robert Hunter, a Scotch-
man, who proved himself to be one of the best governors
New York had during the colonial period. He was liberal,
wise, refined, and congenial. He was most enthusiastically
received by the people upon his arrival. He soon won
the good will of the Council, but diifcrcnccs regarding the
revenue always stood as an insuperable barrier to a com-
plete understanding between himself and the Assembly.
Conflict of opinion arose between the Assembly and the
Council as to the relative status of each; the latter claimed
to be the upper house, like the House of Lords, and con-
sidered the Assembly as only an advisory board. The
Assembly, in turn, kept a check upon both Council and
governor by doling out funds for the support of the govern-
ment in yearly instalments.

In Maryland, we. have seen that the English Revolution
of 1688 had its counter eflfect in the overthrow of Lord
Baltimore's proprietary government. This occurred in
1 69 1, and the next year Sir Lionel Copley assumed the
reins of government. His first act was to dissolve the con-
vention and call an Assembly which immediately proclaimed
William and Mary. By another act, the Church of Eng-
land was established, and the principle of taxation for its
support was recognized. Annapolis was made the capital
of the province. In 1700 an act was passed establishing
uniformity of worship throughout the province. The in-
fluence of the Dissenters in England, however, prevented
its acceptance by the crown. This most sensible use of the

veto by the crown did not, unforuniatcly, benefit the- Roman
Catholics. They were denii J the privilege of celebrating
Mass publicly. Furthermore, no teacher of the young could
be a Ron^aii Catholic, and very often the property of members
of that faith was confiscated.

During the whole period that Ma:)land w is a royal
province the Assembly enjoyed a most unusual degree of
power. The delegates refused to establish a permanent
reventtCy and put a tax on imported negroes for the purpose
of obfltnicting tfadr unpoftatioii. The Antmhlj was not
successful, liowerer, in engrafting English rights and liber-
ties on the colony. Several times the attempt was made, but
on every occasion it met with scant courtesy at the hands
of the crown. Free schools and libraries were esublished.
In 1 7 10 there were nearly thirty thousand free persons in
the province, hut progress was by no means rapid.

Before leaving this period, let us turn for a moment to a
considenttion of what was at times called the negro insur-
rection of 1 7 12, to distinguish it from the more serious plot
of I74i« The importation of negroes at this date was per-
haps more lucrative than any other kind of commerce. The
importance of the traffic is clearly evidenced by the est ah
lishment of a slave market at the foot of what is now Wall
Street, an New York. The traffic continued to prosper
until, as a result, right in the midst of the despair caused
by the failure of a second Canadian expedition, alarming
symptoms began to manifest themselves. Nearly half the
population of New York City in 171 2 — then about six
thousand — was " black." All the wealthy families owned
slaves, there being in some establishments as many as fifty.
The ir^nrirancc nncl stupidity of the slaves nnd the lack of
unity among them srcniccl to preclude most clteciually any
possible danger fioni them. It is claimed however, that a
number of thc x- ru iroes who had received some hard usage
from their masters planned a scheme of revenge. They
were to kill as many citizens as possible, without regard to
whether they had been injured by them or not. Meeting

at midnight in an orchard not far from the present Maiden
Lane, they armed themselves with guns^ swords, hatchets,
and butcher knives. Their first criminal act was to set fire
to an outhouse for the purpose of alluring their unsuspecting
victims* The ruse was successful, and as a result nine
men were murdered in a most brutal manner and six were
seriously wounded*

Those who escaped gave the alarm, and the governor
sent a detachment of soldiers from the fort at double-quick
time. Before the soldiers arrived, the negroes had taken to
the woods. Sentinels were stationed at all the ferries to pre-
vent their escaping from the island, and on the following
day they were all captured. Six committed suicide, but the
others were brought to trial. Twenty-one were condemned
and executed. Of these, several were burned at the stake,
others were hanged, one was broken on the wheel, and one
hung in chains to die of starvation. A large number of
others were arrested on suspicion of being implicated in the
cnnic. They were afterward released tor lack of sufficient
evidence to convict, or were pardoned by the governor.

CHAPTER XIV



GROiVrH OF AN ARIsroCRATIC COLONY, 1714-17^4

Hunter's wise administratioii of nine years marks a
period of steady growth and prosperity in New York. The
increase in population following the Leislerian rebellion was
slow, due undoubtedly to a large extent to the continuous
exodus of young men to New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Then, again, the French and Indian wars and the conse-
quent danger of invasions from Canada prevented the settle^
ment of the interior of the province. Still, in 1720 New
York province had a population of approximately twenty-
seven thousand whites and four thousand blacks. From
1693 1720, the strength of the militia had increased
from two thousand nine hundred and twenty-three to six
thousand.

The only bar to a thoroughly healthy social p-rowth
during this period was the alarming increase of servitude of
■A\ kinds, but especially that of the negroes. The lower
stratum of society, or the servile class, of New York was
the same in kind as in the other colonies, especially Virginia.
There were indented white servants and negro slaves. The
indented white servants were either: first, convicts shipped
from Great Britain to get rid of them \ or secondly, poor men
and women kidnapped and sold into servitude; or thirdly, re-
demptioners, who were to pay their passage money by servile
labor after arriving in the colonies. Owing to the fact that
the great knded estates of New York were cultivated brgely

by free tenant farmers, servile labor was by no means the
rule there, as it was in the Southern provinces. Negro slaves
and indented white servants were far less numerous than in
the South. Nevertheless, the rapid increase of both classes
in New York during this period was a matter for serious
apprehensioA.

Negro slaves were probably first brought to New Am-
sterdam in 1625, and from rhat time on throughout the
colonial period the traffic aftorded remunerative returns to
those who were engaged in it. The average price for slaves
of both sexes was from £^0 to ^^50. They were assigned
ali kinds of tasks, agricultural and domestic, from plowmen
t(j \ alcts. The slaves appear to have been fairly well treated
and were not overworked. Mrs. Grant asserts, in her
Memoirs of an American Lady (i, 51), that among the people
of Albany ^^even the dark aspect of slavery was softened
into a smfle." The ^dstence of the ^bad" negro made it
necessaiy, however, to enact laws restricting considerably
the privileges of ali the others. They were not permitted
to congregate in numbers exceeding four, and they could
not cany weapons of any description, under a penalty of ten
lashes at the whipping post. Another act provided that no
slave could go about the streets after nightfall anywhere
beyond a certain limit without a lighted lantern, "so as the
light thereof may be plainly seen," In 1746, New York
City had a population of eleven thousand seven hundred and
twenty-three, and of this number two thousand four hun&gt;
dred and forty-four were slaves. John Cruger, a slave dealer
from 1 712 to 1 733, was an ex-alderman of New York, and
afterward served four consecutive terms as mayor of the
city. This shows hov/ the traffic was viewed in New York
at this period. Tlic negro slave trade was regarded some-
what in the same light as we consider the immigration traffic
of to-day. The profits from the trade were too great and
the social odium incurred in engaging in it too insignificant
for the thrifty New York merchants to resist the temptation
of embarking in the business. There were, in addiuun to the

negro slaves, also Jiulmn slaves. On November 30, 1711,
Wc iiad that the foINnviiig law was passed: "All negro and
Indian slaves that arc let our to hire within the city du take
up their standing in order to be hired at the market house at
the Wall Street Slip."

Commerce naturally expanded with the increase m popu-
latioo. Especially was this true in regard to the trade with
the Indiant* The exports of the province far exceeded the
importt. Ffom 1 7 1 7 to 1 7 20, the former amounted to ahotit

2,000 per annum, and the ktler, 21,000. The navl-&gt;
g^okui laws had not henefited the British merchants so much
as they expected, although attempts were made to enforce
the laws rigidly. It was the aim of British merchants to
restrict manufactures in the colonies and in this way com&gt;
pel the colonists to purchase their goods in England. There
is an interesting letter from Caleb Heathcote to the Lords
of Trsde^ written in 1 708, that throws some light on this
policy of the British merchants: ^ My proposal was to divert
the Americans from going on with their linen and woollen
manufactories, and to turn their thoughts rn such things as
might be beneficial to Great Britain. They are already so
fiir advanced in their numufactories that three-fourths of the
linen and woollen, especially of the coarser sort they use, is
made amongst them." The British merchants likewise
planned the development of a business in naval stores. We
have seen how Hunter tried to carry out this idea by im-
porting the Palatines, and how signally he failed in that
attempt.

Thonp;h there were manv mirifir occurrences durinrr the
remainder nf (jovernor Hunter's administration, there is
but one matter of importance we need stop to consider.
That is the constant bickering between him and his As-
sembly. Let us bear in mind that this was not particu-
larly characteristic of Hunter and was in no sense due to
any peculiarity of his. Every colonial governor had very
much the same experience, though not every one was so
nearly free from blame as was he. There were constant

strugi^Ies in all the colonies lutwecn the governors and their
Assemblies relative to the nionc) question. The royal gov-
ernors insisted that their salaries and the funds for the sup-
port of the colony should be voted once and fur all and at
a fixed rate. The Assemblies insisted on voting salaries
and supplies every year or at every meeting of the legis-
lature. In this way they hoped to retain a firm control
of the public purse« The colonies realized that just as
soon as they voted fixed sums for long periods they would
cease to have a check upon the arbitrary will of the gov-
ernors. The latter were helpless as long as the Assemblies
controlled the public purse. The people understood this
full well, and consequently guarded their interests jealously.
But it brought on constant strife and occasioned much bad
feeling. The different royal and proprietary governors made
the question one of privile]^." They maintained that the
action of the Assemblies was an invasion of the rights and
privileges of the king. The colonics claimed, on the other
hand, the English right of voting their supplies periodically.
Thev demanded absolutely the richt of self-taxation just as
it was enjoyed by the English people through the House
of Comnioiis.

During the reigns of Anne, George I., and George II.,
the colonies were entirely successful in retaining this privi-
lege in its integrity. The monarchs, on the other iiand,
through their representative governors, were as yet too weak
to make a successful attack upon this claim of the colonies
to self-taxation. This was due^ no doubt, to the fact that
Anne had not the energy and strength of a man. Geoige I.
and George II. were foreigners, and were thus compelled
to hand over the actual management of home and colo-
nial affairs to their ministers and representatives. When
George III. came to the throne, this condition of affiiirs
became changed. That monarch made the great mistake
of the century in trying to coerce the colonies, where other
monarchs or their gubernatorial representatives had merely
threatened, browbeaten, cajoled, bribed, or begged. The

result in general wc know, (he result in New York we shall
see in due time. We may repeat, therefore, that the
troubles Governor Hunter experienced were neither unusual
nor due to his own peculiarities. In many respects he was

the best governor New York had had for years.

Early in 1719, Hunter hcg:an to make preparations to
return to England. He did this quierlv, because he greatly
feared that the news of his intention miirbt occasion in-
trigues, if it should be known that he was to rc sign his gov-
ernuiciit. No one knew of his decisn ji until June 24th,
when he summoned the House before luni, and, after trans-
acting the special business for which they had been called,
he arose and addressed them 111 the following words: " May
no strife ever happen among you, but that laudable emula-
tion who shall approve himself the most zealous servant and
most dutiful subject of the best of princes, and most useful
member of a well-established and flourishing community of
which you have given a happy example." The Assembly
replied : You have governed well and wisely, like a prudent
magistrate, h'ke an affectionate parent." He returned to
England, but was soon appointed Governor of Jamaica,
where he died in 1734.

"No governor ever left New York with greater ec/at or
carried with him more substantial tokens of good will and
affection" than Hunter. He sailed in July, 17 19, and the
chief command of the province devolved upon Peter Schuyler
as the oldest member of the Council. His short adminis-
tration was marked by very few events of note. A little
over a ycnr from the time of Hunter's farewell to New
York, on the i 7th of September, i 720, Schuyler was re-
lieved from executive duties by the arrival of Governor
William Burnet,

Two men stood out prominently in the affairs of the
colony during the early years of the eighteenth century.
They were Peter Schuyler and Robert Livingston. For
eight years Schuyler served as Mayor of Albany, having
been designated to fill that position in the charter granted

by Governor Dongan. He was the leader of the movement
against T.eisler, and was a member ol the Provincial Coun-
cil duiiJig I'ictcher's adnnmstration. In 1700, he was ap-
pointed colonel of the Albany County miiitia, and as a
soldier stood foremost in the colony. He had the con-
fidence of the Iroquois, whom he frequently led in attacks
upon the Fiench and Indians* He treated the red men as
his hrethren, and frequently invited them to visit htm at his
home, to sit at his table* The confidence with which he
inspired the Indians made him a valuable man in all the
political conferences between them and the whites. He
was known to the Indians familiarly as ^ Brother Quiden"
His knowledge of the impending dangers from Canada
came from the red men. To convince the British govern-
ment of such dangers, he, with five Iroquois chiefs, made
a memorable visit to England at his own expense. The
presence of such strangers in England was an unusual
event and created a sensation throughout that country.

To raise funds, Schuyler hit upon the novel idea of ex-
hibiting his five warriors before the public, it was during
tins visit that the Iroquois warriors came upon the half-
starved Palatines and out of sympathy and commiseration
offered them some of their lands along the Schoharie.
Schuyler's arguments were heeded by the British court, but
out of neglect or jobbery on the part of the ministry the
expedition fitted out at that tune proved a failure. Later,
however, his policy was carried to a triumphant end.

Among the noted families into which the Schuylers had
married was that of the Livingstons* Robert Livingston
was closely allied to Schuyler in his opposition to Leisler,
and favored Leisler*s execution. He received the manor
of Tjvingston thnnigh a grant obtained from Governor
Dongaa and confirmed by George I. in 1 7 15. He after-
ward became Mayor of Albany, was a member of the Pro-
vincial Council, and often sat in the General Assembly.
His descendants have played an active part in the afiarrs
of the country.

GROU^rU OF AN JRISTOCRATIC COLONY



Governor William Burnet began his administration on
September 17, 1720. He was the son of a lushoj^ famous
as a historian. Burnet huiiself was a man ul Icaiiuiig and
accomplishments. He had lost money in the South Sea
Bubble, and thought to retrieve his fortunes by exchanging
with General Hunter the office of comptroller of customs
in London for the governorship of New York. He allied
hintelf with the fiknds of Governor Hunter, and further
atrengthened his position in the colony by a marriage with
a daughter of a prominent Dutch merchant — Abraham van
Home. He had no difficulty whatever in securing a grant
of revenue for five years, which afterward was extended to
eig^t years. Throughout his administration he was zeal^
ously supported by £e colonists In the chief measures for
the gfXMl of the colony.

Burnet deemed it advisable to meet the Indian sachems
in Albany during the summer of 172 1. He treated them
kindly, and soon won their friendship and their promise to
agree to his terms of peace. On his part, he promised
to establish an English settlement in their wild country.
They referred to his marriage with an American girl with
considerable felictty, and presented the bride with a few
beavers for pin money. They furthermore added most
significantly that it was ^&lt; customary for a brother upon his
marriage to invite his brethren to be merry and dance.*'
Burnet took this suggestion in good part and thanked them
for their good wishe*;. Hr then distributed presents, and
ordered several barrels of bccf to be given them "to rejoice
with and tlaru e over."

Nevertheless, in 1 722, the verv m \t year, the Five
Nations were reported as making frequent inroads into
Virginia, contrary to a treaty of long standing. In Penn-
sylvania, a quarrel between the whites and some Indians of
the Five Nations had resulted in bloodshed. Fearing that
other colonies were tampering with the Indians, Burnet
deemed it a(l\ isable to see the sachems himself and expostu-
late with them tor their conduct. The Indians, in their turn,

promised that if representatives from Virginia would meet
them they would renew the covenant chain and keep clear
of the Virginia territory in nil their future hunting and war-
like expeditions. Burnet interpreted this to mean that fine
presents would refresh their memories, and so wrote to the
Lords of Trade.

He furthermore proposed a congress of governors and
commissioners from all the colonics to meet the Indian
chiefs at Albany. His ostensible object was to confirm
treaties } but his real object was to show the Indians that
the English could act in unison as well as the French*
This congress met in September, 1722. Governor Spots-
wood, of Virginia, attended the congress and frankly sub-
mitted all the propositions that he had made with the
Indians up to that time. Sir William Keith, of Pennsyl-
vania, presided over the congress, while Burnet acted as
agpnt for Boston. The session lasted several days and
terminated satisfactorily to all parties.

This congress memorialized the English government to
grant funds to erect trading posts and forts throuwhont
the Indian countrv. In this way the encroachments of the
French could be antieipated. Had the government acted
upon this advice, millions uf dollars and thousands of lives
would have been saved ; and furthermore, the great French
and Indian War might not have been precipitated. Eng-
land, however, paid little attention to the appeal, and the
project was reluctantly abandoned.

Burnet had taken possession of Oswego and in 1722
established a trading post there. This annoyed the French,
who feared the trade from the upper lakes would be drawn
thither and diverted from Montreal. Securing the consent
of the Onondagas, the French restored their trading post
and fort at Niagara. The other members of the con-
federacy objected, however, and their representatives met
Burnet in council at Albany in 1726. They said: "We
come to you h nvlintr, and this is the reason why we howl,
that the Governor of Canada comes upon our land and

builds thereon." The governor, in response, promised
much, but could perform little. The merchants of New
York and Albany profited by the illicit trade in Indian goods
with Montreal, and opposed the governur ui his Indian
policy. He could do very little for the protection of the
Indians.

On June ii, 1727, George L died and Geo^ 11. as-
cended the throne of Efigland. Contrary to his desire^
Burnet was removed in 1728 from the government of New
York to that of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. He
was escorted with much ceremony on his journey from New
York to Boston, and carried with him this g^&gt;od will of the
colonists. On the borders of Rhode Island he was met by a
committee from Boston. A member of this committee was
a Colonel Taylor, who made a rather facetious reply to a
comprint by Burnet of the long graces said at the meals
where they had stopped along the road. The governor
inquired when they would shorten. "The graces will in-
crease in length until you get to Boston; after that, they
will shorten till you come to your government in New
Hampshire, where your excelk ru y will find no grace at all,"
replied Taylor. One important event, at least, character-
ized his administration of New York. He renewed the an-
cient covenant chain with the Indians. This was extremely
seasonable, for the next spring the French prepared to make
further encroachments upon the Kn^lij^h borders. Burnet's
successor was Colonel John Moiugumery, a gentleman of
honor to George II. while he was Prince of Wales. Mont-
gomery's great aim was to get money. He avoided contests
with the legislature by giving way to that body in all things.
His administration was a short one. He died in office,
July I, I73i&gt; and it may be said that it was but a faint
shadow that the event cast upon the colonial horizon.
Three important events occurred, however, during his ad-
ministration that we must not fail to record: the estab-
lishment of a public library in New York City in 1729}
the granting of a new charter to the city in 1 730 ; and the

settlement of the Connecticut-New York bouodaiy dispute

on May 14, i 731.

Rip \'nn f);u"n sticcrrded Montrrnrnery, as acrintr rrovernnr.
He was the oldest nu njlicr and the president of the (\iuncii,
and "one of the people of hgure." For thirteen months he
filled the position with dignity until relieved by Colonel
William Cosby, who arrived in New York on August i,
1732. Coshy's ailniinistration is particularly remembered
by reason of the great money dispute with Rip van Dani.
It led to a trial which created the must intense interest
throughout the English colonies. The Assembly considered
Cosby a friend of the people, and followed the popular
wish by readily granting a revenue to support the govern-
ment for six years. This included a sabuy for the governor
of £i^$0Oj together with certain emoluments amounting to
£400. In addition, £i$o was voted to pay his expenses
on a journey to Albany, besides a sum to bie expended in
presents for the Iroquois. Afterward ^750 was voted him
as a present in recognition of his services in helping to pie*
vent the passage of legislation detrimental to the interests
of the colony. Chief Justice Smith said : "All this did not
satisfy the colonel, who had come to New York to make
a fortune, and had not sense enough to see that it was his
interest to improve the popitlnrity which attended, ur rather
preceded, his arrival. Meeting Mr. Morris, who hnd a seat
in the Assembly, he, on hearing of the gratuity voted In ihc
Assembly, exclaimed, ^Darnn them! why did they not add
shilHngs and pence?***

But Van Ham, the merchant, caused still fiercer ire in
ihc breast of the choleric colonel wlicn a settlement of
accounts was called for. While Rip van Dam was in the
chair he, of course, received the salary of governor. But
Colonel Cosby brought with him the king^s order, dated
May 31, 1732, for an equal partition between himself and
the president of the Council of the salaiy, emoluments,
and perquisites of the office, from the time Van Dam first
administered the government to that at which Cosby relieved

him. The opinion of the Assembly was asked as to whether
the whole salar)^ should be paid to the acting governor
or only a part of it. The Assembly refused to deliver an
opinion and refc rred the question to the Council. The
Council consc ated that the warrants should be drawn for
the whole sum.

After the Assembly adjournc d, Cosby produced his order
from the king. Van Dam knew that the governor had
received while in England, upon various pretences, sums
of money which exceeded what had been paid to him-
self by over ^2^4^00. Consequently, he stated his re-
ceipts at jQij^JS V' lod'y and those of the governor as
Liiy^oj i%s, iCkL The English governor denuindeil half
of the former amount; the Dutch merchant agreed, pro-
vided he received half of the latter amount. He would
retain his salaiy, if his opponent was content; otherwise,
he appealed to the order for an equal division of receipts
between them. The governor created a court of exchequer
to compel the Dutchman to refund. Van Dam retaliated
by trying to institute a suit at common law. Cosby dreaded
this because Van Dam was popular and the jury would no
doubt declare in his favor. Van Dam's plea to be tried at
common law was overruled, and he was compelled to make
his defence before the judges in equity. His counsel were
William Smith, father of the historian, and James Alexan-
der, father of William Alexander, Lord Stirling, both emi-
nent lawyers. '1 hey ma le exception to the court resorted
to hv the governor. Chief Justice Morris supported the
exception. The two associate justices, James Dc Lancey
and Aldophe Phillipse, voted against the plea. Morris pub-
lished his opmion and sent a copy with explanation to Cosby
on the Iatter*s demand. Cosby was so irritated as a result
of the puhlicaiion that he removed Morris from office after
twenty years of unimpeachable service. De Lancey was
appointed in his place. The governor took this action
without consulting either the Assembly or the Council.
The case was subsequently dropped without settlement, and

Cosby never recovered any of the niDnry. But the procc ed-
ings created two vioiciit parties »uid tlie most bitter teelmgs.
The democratic, or popular, side was with Van Dam, while
the arittociadc side was with Co«by. The opposition to
Cosby took head rapidly, and in 1734 it was decided to send
Morrii to England with the object of securing the removal
of the governor. The utmost secrecy was deemed advisabie.

Out of the Van Dam-Cosby dispute grew another tiial,
which excited interest throughout the English colonies and
stirred New York from centre to circumference: namely,
the trial of John Peter Zenger for publishing a libel.

In 1693, ^iiiis^ni Bradford came from Philadelphia and
brought with him the "art of printing." He was horn in
Leicestershire, England, Mnv 20, 1663, and sailed with
Penn for America, St ptcmhci i, 1682. The first sheet
printed by Bra^lH id in i^hdadelphia was an almanac in 1685,
and the first b ook w as written by George Keith, teacher of
the first school establishment in Pennsylvania. This book
reflected upon the Quakers, and their wrath drove the printer
to New York. Here, October 16, 1725, he commenced
the first newspaper published in that province. It must be
borne ui mind that the earlier governors sent from Kiig
land had instructions not to permit to be erected such a
^pestiferous engine" as a printing press, Bradford became
printer for the governor, and his newspaper was, to some
extent, a government organ.

One of Bradford's apprentices was John Peter Zenger,
born in Germany in 1697. He came from the Palatinate
with his widowed mother, a brother, and a sister, in 1710.
He was one of the partv of Germans hrnnrrht r)i,'cr In* Cjov-
ernor Hunter at the expense of Qiireu Anne's go\ cmnicnt.
In 171 1, he was apprenticed to Bradford, whose paper was
called the New I'otk Gazette. Later, November 5, 1733,
Zenger started an opposition paper, calling it the Ntw I'ork
Weekly Journal, Bradford's paper was in the hands of the
governor and his friends exclusively. ZengePs paper was
taken up by the patriots" — the supporters of Van Dam

and Moms. The Journal was filled with witticisms directed
against the government officials. Bradford replied in the
Gaxette^ but he was not equal to his adversary in sarcasm.
Cosby and his councillors were driven almost to madness.

Further trouble was caused by Zenger's paper tnking up
the accusation afrainst Francis Harrison, one of the coun-
cillors. Harrisdii was accused of having written a letter
thnatcning James Alexander and his familv with bodily
injury unless a certain sum of money were paid. Harrison
indignantly denied the imputation, but suspicion continued
to rest upon him, though he was exonerated by his fellow
counciUoft, The afikir was industriously fomented by the
Jounuil^ and out of it, in part, greir the Imprisonineiit and
trial of John Peter Zenger.

Chief Justice De Lancey called the attention of the g^d
jury in Octoher, 1734, to cenain low ballads in the fFetklj^
T^Mnttf/f which he desig^ted as M libels." He said, in sitb^
stance : Sometimes heavy half-witted men get a knack of
rhyming, but it is time to break them of it when they grow
abusive, insolent, and mischievous with it." The ballads
were ordered to be burned by the common whipper. Later,
attempts were made by the Council to discover the author
of certain other libels. The governor was requested to
have the printer prosecuted. The rf&gt;mmunication was sent
to the Assembly, but was laid upon the table. On No-
vember 2, 1734, numbers 7, 47, 48, and 4() of Zenger's
IV eikly journal were pronounced by the Council "as con-
taining many things tending to sedition and faction, and to
bring his majesty's go\ernment into contempt, and to dis-
turb the peace thereof." These miniNers of the newspaper
were condemned to be burned near the pillory by the com-
mon hangman on Wednesday, the 6th insunt, between
the hours of eleven and twelve in the forenoon. It was
also ordered that the mayor, Robert Lurting, and the rest of
the city magistntes should attend the burning. The coun,
however, would not suffer the order to be entered, and the
aldermen protested that it was arbitrary and illegal. As

recorder, Harrison made a lame efibrt to justify the Coun-
cil by citing the example of the Lords in the celebrated
SachevereU case (1710). He also made reference to the
proceedings against Bishop Burnet's pastoral letter. The
city authorities refused to attend the ceremony, and ordered
their hangman not to obey the order. It is said that the
papers were burned by a negro slave of the sheriff, and
that the spectators were limited to the recorder and a few
dependents of thr c:^^ rrnor.

Zcnger writes in one of the numbers of the Weekly
ymarnal that the " Attorney (jenernl thrn charged me by
informations for Printing and jniMislniiLi Parts of my
J(jiirnals No. 13 and 23 as being yWi*", Si im LiljuSy malicious^
and seditious.** The Council next issue d an order to the
sheriff to arrest Zengcr for printing and publishing the al-
leged libellous papers. The arrest was made on Sunday,
the 17th of November, and Zenger was committed to
prison. A writ of bahios arfm was issued, in order to se-
cure either his discharge or his liberation on bail. The
hearing was held in the presence of some hundreds of the
inhabitants. Among the citations made were Magna Charta ;
The Petition of Right (3 C^lus I. c. i, June 7, 1628);
The Habeas Corpus Act of 31 Carolus II. c. 2, 1679;
2 Hawkins, Chapter 1 5, Section 5 ; The Case of the Seven
Bishops, Temp. Jacobus II. (1688). Needless to say, the
defendant was admitted to l^iil upon furnishing bonds to the
extent of ^^400. In his paper of November 25th, the editor
apologized for not issuing the last Weekly Journal. The
governor^ he said, hnd put him in jail, but he now had the
liberty of speaking through n hole in the door to his assist-
ants. He would consequently supply his customers as
heretofore. His dictations, however, were carefully watched.

The grand jury found no bill against Zenger. Never-
theless, on the 28th of fanuary, 1735, Bradley, the attorney-
general, filed au iiitoj ni.uu&gt;ii against him for false, scandalous,
malicious, and seditious libels, l^his could be done and
the defendant practically indicted without the intervention

of the grand jury. The trial excited the attention of all
America. It b^an in July and occupied the entire sum-
mer. It wzs an important feature in the early history of

the press of New York. It has been styled " the germ
of American freedom and the morning star of that liberty
which subsequently revolutionized America."

The specific libel which brought Zenger mto trouble
was his declaration that "the people of New York think,
as matters now stand, that their liberties and properties are
precarious, and that slavery is likely to be entailed on them
and their posterity, it some things be not anicrulfd." Cosby
was particularly rclerrcd to when the 'Journal lurther de-
clared : " We see men's deeds destroyed, judges arbitrarily
displaced, new courts erected without consent of the legis-
lature, by which, it seems to me, triab by juries are taken
away when a governor pleases; men of known estates de»
nied their voces, contnuy to the received practice of the
best expositor of any law. Who is there in that province
that can call anything his own, or enjoy any liberty longer
than those in the administmtion will condescend to let hun
do it?"

Zenger was defended by James Alexander and William
Smith, of New York, and Andrew Hamilton, of Philadel-
phia, three of the most prominent lawyers in America at
that time. The services of Hamilton were not actually
enlisted until after the other two counsel for the defence
had been disbarred by Chief Justice De Lancey. Alexander
and Smith imnu diatplv attacked the jurisdiction of the court
itself by aiming at the legality of the commissions of Chief
Justice De Lancev and Judge Phillipse. These lawyers
claimed that the commissions of the judges read "during
pleasure" instead of "good behavior" and had been granted
by the governor independently of the Council. These facts,
they maintained, made the commissions void. This attack
upon their commissions was considered a gross contcnipt
of court, and Chief Justice De Lancey, addressing Smith,
said: *^You have brought it to that point, sir, that either

we must go from the bench or you i'loin the bar." He
thereupon ordered the names of the two counsel stncktii
from the rolls, thus excluding them from further practice.
TliiB camed almost a pank, Tbe court then assigned John
Chambers as counsel for the printer, who pleaded ^not
guilty " for his client and obtained a struck juiy,

Hamilton, who had come forward in the meantime and
oilered his services free of charge in the defence of Zenger,
admitted the publication of the articles cBafged in the ^ infor-
mation/' Bradley, the attorney-general, then demanded that
the jury find a verdict for the king. "By no means," ex-
claimed Hamilton. ^It is not the bare printing and pub-
lishing of a paper that will make it a libel; the words
themselves must be libellous, that is, false, scandalous, sedi-
tious, or else my client is not guilty.** Bradley said "the
truth of a lihr! could not be taken in evidence." Hamilton
held that an untruth made the libel, and challenged Bradkn to
prove the facts charged to be false, in which case he would
acknowledge them scandalous, seditious, and a libel. To
save trouble, however, he offered to prove the papers true.
Chief Justice De Lancey intoiined Hamilton that he could
not be udmitted to give the truth of the libel in evidence,
as the law was clear that a libel could not be justiiicJ. He
held, furthermore, that it is " far from being a justification
of a libel that the contents thereof are true, or that the
person on whom it is made had a bad reputation, since the
greater there is of truth in any malicious invective, so much
die more provoking it is." Hamilton's address to the juiy
was foil of sarcasm. He said: ^You are the best judges
of the law and the fact, and are to take upon 3rour8elves to
say whether the papers are false, scandalous, and seditious."

Chief Justice De Lancej charged the jury that they were
judges of tbe fact, but not of the law, and that the truth
of the libel was a question beyond their jurisdiction. This
ruling did not have the least effect upon the jury. Hamil-
ton's arguments had exerted a tremendous influence upon
them, while those of tbe attorney-general had been swept

mnAc like chafF. They returned a verdict, after only a few
minutes' deliberation, of " not guilty.** A great shout of
applause went up after the verdict was known. This an-
gered the judges, and one of them indiscreetly threatened
the leader of the tumult with inipn&gt;onincnt, if he could be
discovered. Captain Norris respoiulcd that huzzas were
cunimon in Westminster Hall, mid were somewlut k&gt;ud at
the uiiie of the acquittal of the Seven Bishops. 1 he next
day the corpoiatiQti of the dty tendered Hamihoo a public
dinner. The coipontion, likewise, voted tlie fteedooi of
the citf in a magnificent g(dd box, ^^for the lemarlable
service done to this and colony, by hit defence of the
rights of mankind and the libeity of die picst.*' In leferrins
to this trial, Gouverncur Morris is reported to have said
that ^instead of dating American liberty from the Stamp
Act, he traced it to die persecution of John Peter Zenger,
because that event reveakd the philosophy of freedom^ both
of thought and speech, as an inborn human right.*'

As a result of the Zenger trial, the scribblers of the
dav took courage and wrote more mipudently than before.
The public prmts were lillcd with srjuihs and ballads and
serious charges against high otlu ials. /cnger*s acquittal
was considered "the great triumph of the age.'* The
democratic party, which stood behind him and supi^orted
him, considered the decision a victory for itself, h was,
indeed, a personal victory for Alexander, Smith, Van Dam,
and die other leaders of that party. The opportunity for
retaliation now presented itself, Alexander and Smith pro-
ceeded against the judges before the next session of the
Assembly for depriving them of their pracdce.

Cosby, in the meanwhile, seemed to lose no opportunity
of gaining the detestation of both friends and neutrals and of
increasing the hatred of his enemies. Me treacherously de-
stroyed deeds belonging to the city of Albany, and in con-
sequence caused almost a panic. He decided to resurvcy

much regard for accuracy, the greatest constemadon was
caused by bis decision. £ven De Lancey could not support
him in this decision, and remonstrated with the governor.
The only reply he received,. however, was: ^What do you
suppose I care for the grumbling rustics?"

Time, however, was shortly to work a way out of the
difficulty. Cosby grew seriously ill during the winter of
1736. Upon being told that his life was in danger, he de-
termined to take his last revenge upon him whom he con-
sidered his worst enemy.' He summoned a few of his
councillors to his bedside, and secretly suspended Van Dam
to prevent his assumption of the government as president
of the Council. Cosby died on March 10, 1736, and when
his death was announced there was little outward mani-
festation of sorrow, but a very considerable inward feeling
of joy. The people, who were fearing a daily attack upon
their land patent rights, rejoiced greatly at being rid of the
tyrant. Cosby had been received joyfully, but was relin-
quished with much more joy. The democratic party was
in high glcc over the prospects of Van Dam's speedy occu-
pancy of the chair ot itatc. 1 heir Lnuaiph had cuuie,
thought they, but in that they were doomed to disappoint-
ment. Early the next morning the Council met and admin-
istered the oath of office to George Clarke, who was next
to Van Dam in the order of age. Van Dam demanded the
great seal of the province and the instructions of the king
from Clarke, but the latter refused to surrender them and
quoted the act of suspension by which Van Dam's claim
was annulled. Van Dam contested the validity of Cosby's
act of suspension, claiming that the former governor was
delirious and irresponsible. He claimed, furthermore, that
Cosby's authority ceased with suspending him from the
Council and that such suspennon could not debar him from
assuming the powers of government after the governor's
death. At all events. Van Dam claimed that his suspension
could not continue after Cosby's death and that the Council
had no authority to qualify Clarke. The sympathy of the

community was, ot course, with Van Dam. The people
trusted him and believed in him. They considered him
grievously wronged and were disposed to support his claims
by force if necessary.

Just at this crisis, despatches arrived from Eng^nd clearly
establishing Clarke in the presidency of the Council and
making him commander-in-chief of the province, and later,
July 30th, lieutenant-governor. Clarke now tried to con-
ciliate all parries. He brought about a reconciliation be-
tween the judges and Alexander and Smith. Their right
of pleading before the bar was returned to them. Clarke's
action in the matter was commendable, but it lost him the
confidence of the most influential members of the aristocratic
party. De Lancey especially was not pleased.

Let us turn for a moment from the course of the narra-
tive to consider that most curious manifestation of popular
panic known as the Negro Plot of 174 1. Tt is especially
interesting in that it shows into what excesses people ordi-
narily conservative and normally sane may be led by mob
influences. The psychology of panics and mobs is a subject
in practical sociology extremely interesting, but up to the
present little studied and far less understood. History
affords overwhelming proof to substantiate the fact that the
wisest of men may give way to these subtle influences
when the circumstances are peculiarly favorable. For pur-
poses of illustration, we have but to refer to the following
manifestations of a tendency to return to the social status of
the brute: the New England and old England witchcraft "
delusions; the various lynchings that characterize parts of
the United States at present; the stampedes in burning
theatres or the mad rushes in rime of peril ; the senseless
runs on banks; and the violence of a mob. All point to
the fact that men in groups are subject to influences entirely
different from those that govern them as individuals. Cotton
Mather, the New England divine of ^^Magnalia" fame, was
one of the wisest and most self-possessed men in the New
Enghmd of his time. Nevertheless, he was drawn into the




354



MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



vortex of fanatical persecution that swept over New England
during the last decade of the seventeenth centuiy.

It must be admitted, however, that in the case before us
there was indeed a veiy solid foundation for the uneasiness'
that manifested itself on the part of the inhabitants of New
York City in the year 1741. Ever since the unfortunate
ai&amp;ir of 1 71 2, the citizens of New York had been more or
less afraid of an • outbreak on the part of the negro slaves,
who comprised so laige a part of the population. Laws
were enacted from time to time to keep them under thorough
control. Forty lashes on the bare back was the penalty if
more than two negroes were seen together, or if a negro
was seen walking with a club in his hand outside of his
master's grounds. Mention has been made of the fact that
English traders flooded New Amsterdam with negro slaves,
regardless of the remonstrances of the authorities. The
province was upon the point of enacting a stringent set of
laws against this practice when the colony was delivered
over to the English. Under Dutch rule the slaves had not
been abused, but, on the contrary, had been treated mildly
and gcntl\ . In consequence, they regarded no punishment
worse than a threat to sell thcni to other masters. After
the English conquest, however, the colonial records are full
of the arrangements made by the English government to
impose slaves on its colonies. Many members of the gov-
ernment had hrge interests in the slave trade, and it was
their policy to encourage the traffic* Lord Combury's
instructions were to encourage the imponation of slaves
into New York province, notwithstanding the efforts of the
colonists to stop it.

On February 28, 1741, the denizens of New York were
terrified at the knowledge that a robbery had been com-
mitted at Robert Hogg's, a worthy tradesman of the middle
class. Pieces of silverware, coins, linen, and other articles
were stolen. Suspicion fell on some negroes who had
been in the habit of meeting together at a tavern on North
River. The keeper of the tavern was a man named Hughson.

GROlVrH OF AN ARISTOCRAriC COLONY

His wife had a white servant named Mary Burton, a girl
of only sixteen years of age, with very low tendencies.
This gprl was at once suspected of being an accomplice of
the negroes, and was arrested. In order to screen herself,
she implicated her master, his wife, his daughter, some of
the negroes who had been seen in the tavern, and several
other persons. Pleased with the notoriety which she had
thus gained for herself, she proceeded to invent a tissue of
lies that threatened to inculpate persons of a much higher
social standiiiL: than those she had at first drawn into the
plot. She used all the low cunning she possessed to en-
courage the idea that a negro uprising was contemplated.
The whole community was thorough l\ alarmed. One of
the negroes, John Varrick, was proved by witnesses to
have concealed some of the stolen property on his master's
premstes and was immediately thrown into prison. Mary
. Burton next implicated a woman of bad character called
P^gy Ouvy.

Rumors now became life that the negroes intended to
attack their niasters and bum the town, hoping thus to set
themselves free. The following month, March i8th, a
fire broke out in a house within the enclosure of the fort.
This caused the terror of the inhabitants to be excited to
the highest pitch. No one felt safe; the citizens secretly
formed organizations for self-protection. To allay the fears
of the public the governor sent a communication to the
legislature, stating that the fire m the fort had been started
by a plumber while repairing the root of one of the build-
ings. Hut other fires followed in quic k succession, and
although one was caused by sparks from a tobacco pipe,
and another by a foul chimney, nevertheless, the citiz-cns,
now thoroughly demoralized, traced everything to the negro
slaves. This can be more readily understood when we
realise that there were at the time over two thousand slaves

were believed to be particularly despenCe chanclen. Thejr
had been free negroes, but bad been captured and sold into
slavery and were, in consequence, very restive in their
captivity. A rumor that these slaves had determined to
rebel added considerably to the general state of uneasiness.
Another cause for alarm was given by a report that the
Jesuit priests in Canada were inciting the Indians on the
northern borders of the province to revolt j furthermore,
that they were to be aided by a negro revolt in all the towns,
the idea being the subjection of the colony bv the French.

time, gangs of roughs insulted respectable citizens or in-
dulged in street fights with each other* The ««Fly Boys*'
and the ^Long^ridge Gang," for example, had frequent

Hall Park.

On April 21, 1741, a most notable giroup of the mer-
chants of New York was called to compose die gnmd

Jury. Mr. Philllpse was the foreman of the jury and
charged it to summon the arch-disturbers of the peace.
Mar}' Burton, her former master, the innkeeper Hughson,
and the unfortunate outcast Peggy Carey were summoned
to appear. The testimony against the negroes proved them
dishonest, but not conspirators. Nevertheless, two negroes
were condemned to be hanged on Monday, May ii, 1741.
These were Prince, who had led such a disorderly life that
the community was undoubtedly well rid of htm, and Cesar
Roosevelt. The latter was hanged on the gibbet near the
present site of the intersection of Centre, Chatham, and
Peail Streets. Other trials followed during the whole
summer of 1741, and thirteen negroes were burned at the
stake, eighteen hanged, and seventy transported. The tavern
keeper Hughson, his wife, and maid were convicted of being
receivers of stolen goods and of keeping a thieves' meeting
place. A French priest and school teacher, John Uiy, owed

hit convktioii at much to bit iiubiUtf to tpeak English at
to anf real conpUcity in crime. He wat accuted of con-
spiracy and of offidadng at a priett. The hw uiMler iHiich
he was convicted and executed had been passed during
the administration of Lord BeUomontf about 1700. The
piejudioe ag^st the Roman Catholict at that time had
beoi very strong. These executions were absolutely un-
warranted — especially that of the priest. But the majority
of the cttizens were insane with terror and suspected thie
priest of persuading their negn&gt; tkvet to rise up agunst
them.

The excitement was somewhat allayed by the enactment
of severe laws against negro meetings. These rigorous laws
s&lt;&gt;&lt;m frll into ahr^, ance. Within ten vrnrs the negroes were
admitu'd to the rights and privileges ot' free siihierts; and
more care was taken as to the class of negroes unpurted. It
is unjust to the people of New York ot that day to condemn
without reserve their action in this matter. We may see
very clearly from our exalted position of to-day that no
alarm need have been felt either of an uprising of the
negroes or of an invasion of the Indians, but such was not
the case in 1 74 1 . The terror caused by both of these fears
wat real. The people of New York luid for years dreaded
outbreaks from both quarters, and it mutt be admitted that
many alarming incidents had occurred from time to time to
connnn them in their fears. Furthermore, the false testi-
mony of the worthless giri, Mary Burton, was at that time *
accepted without reserve.

TTiat part of the War of the Austrian Succession called in
America King George's War was not formally declared until
March, 1 744. Nevertheless, actual hostilities had broken
out in the colonies before the end of Lieutenant-governor
Clarke's administration. In this war, England was arrived
against both France and Spain, and the colonics of the re-
spective countries were involved. New '^'ork was, of course,
particularly exposed to ravages hv the French and Indians
down through the Champlain, Mohawk, and Hudson valleys.

Renewed tttemptt were now made to cement the union with
the Iroquois. But it was not Clarke and his counsels that
were chiefly instrumental in winning the friendship of these
Indians. That credit belongs to a man well known in
the hii»Lory of the Mohawk valley — a man second only to
Arendt van Corlear. This man was Sir William Johnson,
the nephew of Adfniral Sir Peter Warren.

Johnson was aii Irishman of high birth, coming origi-
nally from Warrentown, County Down. He had settled
in the Mohawk valley, not frr from the site of Sche*
nectady, and had been successful from the start in the
management of his family estates and in his relations with
the Iroquois, whose confidence and affection he eariy ac-
quired. He formed a settlement upon the estate of his
uncle, and took every opportunity of visiting the sachems
in their castles and the common people, both whites and
Indians, in their huts. The following Story is related of
Sir William Johnson, which illustrates exceedingly well the
tact and diplomacy characteristic of all his dealings with
the Indians.

At one time a Mohawk chief coveted a new scarlet coat
trimmed with gold lace, which Sir Williatn had just received
from r^ondon. He hesiuied only a day or two before call-
ing at Johnson Hall in the familiar manner which Johnson
had inaugurated, and said he had dreamed a dream. He
had dreamed that the grand knight gave him his fine red
* coat. Sir William understood the significance of the hint,
and, in tender consideration of his own popularity,*' it is
said, gave the chieftain the much desired treasure. But
Sir William, too, presently dreamed a dream. He went to
see the chieftain, and related it to him. He had dreamed
that the chieftain and his council gave him a large tract
of land, the boundaries of which Sir William designated
with geographical precision, from such a tree to such a
rivulet. The gift was made, but the old Indian said:
" Ugh ! I no dream any more. White chief dream better
than Indian."

The advinbility of appotndng a governor for New York
had been considered for tome tune. Clarke's admin»*
tration had lasted seven years, but had tenntnated rather

ingloriously. His important concessions to the Assembly
relative to the disposition of the revenue only whetted
its ;ip|xtite for other privileges. The Assembly next
domandcd ihc right to appoint its own treasurer. VV^hen
ihis was conceded, the privilege of choosing the auditor-
general was claimed. Failure to secure this led to the
withhuUiiiiL!; of the salary of thiit otficcr and estrangement
between the A.s.senihly and tiic lieutenant-governor. Clarke
was succeeded by Admiral George Clinton, who arrived
in New York on September 22, 1743. He was the second
fon of the sixth Earl of Lincoln, and has been described
as a &lt;*nian of talent and libeiality.'* He troubled himself
little beyond taking measures to repair his fortunes, and
allowed himself to drift along smoothly in the direction of
least rewstance.

We wiU recall that even before the beginning of Clin-
ton's admioistnttioji the conditions in Europe were most
threatening, France again began to assume an attitude of
hostility toward England. News, however, of the formal
declaration of hostilities did not reach New York until
early in July of 1 744. There was great alarm, for it was
well known that the city and colony were almost (Icfence-
less by land and sea. Sudderilv atn! without warning, the
news came that the enemy was mo\ in&lt;&gt; up the northern
border and that the English traders had retreated from
Osweeo precipitately. This created a very unfavorable
impfes.&gt;.ion upon the minds of the Indian allies, who were
not slow ill (]( tecting any evidences of a uant of courage
on the part of tlie English. Many of the Indians had come
long distances for the purpose of trade, and when they found
Oswego deserted th^ were naturally veiy much vexed.
To prevent disaficction among the Indians, Oswego
then reinforced and special sums of money were vottd for
the defence of Albany and Schenectady*

In many respects^ the moct important event of this war
in America wat the capture of Louisburg by the colonial

troops. The discussion of the question of ways and means
for the defence of the province broke the harmony that had
hitherto existed between the governor and the Assembly.
New England was making preparations to attack Louis-
burg, which vvns tlic strongest fort in America north of the
Gulf of Mexico — tlu \ eritabk ( Gibraltar of the continent.
Cluiion received an urgent letter Ivom Go\ cmor Shirley, of
Massachusetts, "recommending a closer bond ot union be-
tween the colonics " in order that the war might be pressed
to a more successful conclusion. When Clinton urged
attch proceedings on the part qf New Yofk, he was re-
minded of the liheiality of the varioui appropriationa and
told that the taxes of the people were already too gr^ and
oug^t not to he mcreaaed except for purpoeet of defence.
The Aasembty treated the governor very undTilly — ^refused
to answer hb questions and dehyed or refused war appro-
priations, holding that the conquest of Canada belonged
exclusively to the crown. As king as Louisburg remained
in the hands of the French, the peace of New England and
New York was in constant danger of being distuihed*
Great Britain herself was not likely to take an active
part in the reduction of Louisburg, for fear of a threat-
ened in^ nsinn from France. On the other hand, the colo-
nists ha(i for some years urged the British government
to seize the fort and to invade Canada, and had even
promised to bear the larger part of the expense. The
British govern ment finally ai&gt;sented, but failed signally to
fulfil its promise.

It soon became evident that the home governnicjit d d
not intend 10 assist maienally Hi ihe capture of Louisburg;
accordingly, the colonists determined to bring about its
capture through their own efibrts. The proposal of an
expedition against the strong^ld first came up before the
General Court of Massachusetts and was adopted by a
majority of one vote. Circular letters soliciting aid were

sent to the other colonies. The matter came up before the
New York Assembly, and after a long and spiritrd debate
;^3,000 of the local currency was granted for the expedition.
This seemed to the governor a niggardly grant, so he set
about raising assistance by private subscriptions. He also
sent ten eighteen-pounders from the king's magazine; yet,
notwithstanding the aid granted by the other colonies, Mas-
sachusetts was forced'^to bear most of the expense of the
undertaking.

An armed fleet set sail from Boston in April, 1 745 ; and
after being joined by several vessels from the West India
fleet, the combined ships proceeded to attack Louisbuig.
Five attempts were made to silence an island battery which
protected the harbor, but all were failures. Several days
prior to these attacks, supply vessels for the fort had been
captured by the colonial fleet. Many of his troops becom-
ing mutinous, the commander of the fort saw that all further
resistance was useless, and capitulated on June 17th. By
the terms of capitulation, six hundred and fifty regular
soldiers and one thousand three hundred inhabitants of the
town were to be shipped to France. In the siege the loss
was about one hundred and fifty, but many of those left to
garrison the fort perished afterward from sickness. Johnson,
in his History of the French JVm\ says: "Though it was
the most brilliant success the English achieved during the
war, English historians hardly mention it.** Nevertheless,
it was one of the most splendid achievements of the age.
Europe was astonished at the successful issue of the expedi-
tion, and the American colonies were awakened to a reali-
zation of their power. The officers in charge of the
expedition were handsomely rewarded with promotions and
distinctions. There was a strange reluctance, however, on
the part of the crown to reimburse the colonies for the
heavy expenses they had incurred; but the claim was prose-
cuted with diligence, and the colonies finally, in 1749,
obtained 183,649, which was equitably divided among
them. Notwithstanding the importance of the capture,

Louitburg was given back to the French -by the Treaty

of Aix-la-Chapelle, October 7, 1 748.

During the autumn of 1745, Saratoga was destroyed by
a party of French and Indians from Crown Point. More
than thirty families were massacred and many persons
taken into captivity. The utmost consternation prevailed
at Albany. I'amilies from the Mohawk-Hudson valley fled
precipitately from their honies, loudly condemning the
government that had permuted such a condition to exist.
The colony was aroused and showed a certain spasmodic
desire to correct its omissions. But as every appropria-
tion of money precipitated fresh quarrels, little was in reality
accomplished.

HanUy anything of importance charscterized the period
1746 to 1754 except the constant bickering between the
governor and the Assembly. £arly in the spring of the
year 1746, Clinton asked to be allowed to return to Eng-
land for the recovery of his heahh. He was heartily dis-
gusted with New York. But the French were so active
and the affairs of the colonies in so critical a condition^ that
he could not be relieved at that time. In October, 1 748,
the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was proclaimed. From the
outbreak to the close of hostilities the war had lasted
nearly five years, and things were about the same at the
end as at the beginning. It took another war of seven
years to settle definitely the dispute between England and
France.

The quarrels between Clinton and the Assembly are im-
portant historically, because it was during his administration
that the new doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy in Ameri-
can colonial a&amp;irs was first practically tested. It should
be remembered that during the early part of their history
the colonies held that they were under the domination of no
outside authority, unless it were that of the king. Further-
more, that his power over them was limited, because he
had delegated it to others through charter grants. Cer-
tainly, they claimed. Parliament had no authority over them.

As soon as Parliament gpined the upper hand under the
ministerial fonn of government of the Hanoverian mon-
archal just so soon did Parliament begin to assume su-
preme control of the colonies. Also, what is more to the
point, Pariiament began to devise schemes for carrying that
assumption into piactical effect.

The ministry now decided that it would be the proper
course to experiment upon New York. It deemed the return
of peace to he a most favorable time to make the experi-
ment. I hcrc would not be the danger of lukcvvarmncss
on the part ut" the colonists in waging the war against Eng-
land's enemy. Nor would there be the graver danger of
the culonies going over to that enemy, as there would have
been dunng the war just ended. Consequently, the nAirustr\
resolved to extort from the Assembly two prerogati\es that
had always been claimed by the central governincnt, but
which had never been admitted by the colonies; in fact,
these prerogatives had been denied the home government
by the colonial Assemblies from the verv beginning. They
had always evinced the most decided determination never
to yield an inch. These two prerogatives were : first, the
privilege of demanding fixed salaries for all regal officers of
whatiever character without a periodic voting of the same,
whether yearly or otherwise; secondly, the privilege of having
a permanent revenue at the royal disposal to be disbursed as
it best pleased the authorities, without rendering any account
whatsoever to the representatives of the people. It is very
evident that these two prerogiatives as claimed on the part
of the home government were the crux of the whole trouble
between the governors and the colonial l^shtures. They
were likewise the causes of all the quarrels as between the
king and the colonial legislatures and as between Parliament
and the colonial legislatures. And finally, it may be held
with a considerable degree of historical exactness that th^
were the great underlying causes of the American Revolu-
tion. In this particuhur New York experiment, Parlia-
ment determined to gain these prerogatives by a process



364 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYUKD



of bulldozing and extortioning; or, if this failed, by craftily
managing affairs in such a manner that by producing ex-
treme disorder in the province the interposition of Parliament

would be certain.

Unfortunately for Clinton, he was the unwelcome instru-
ment by which the disciplining process was to be accom-
pli&lt;;hcd. This policy on the part of the British ministry to
compel Ne w York to acknowledge these two prerogatives
led to still further differences among Governor Clinton,
his Council, and the Assembly. A legislative deadlock
would have been ultimately the consequence, had not a
change in the administrative head of the province been first
effected. Clmtcm consequently became increasingly im-
patient to return to England. On a trip to the Indian
country, July 4, 1753, Clinton revealed the secret that he
was daily expecting a successor and that upon his arrival
he would sail for England.

On Sunday, October 7th, Sir Danvers Osborne, the
new governor, once a member of Parliament for Bedford-
shire, and' brother-in-law of the Earl of Halifax, arrived.
De Lancey, amid popular huzzas, received the commis-
sion as lieutenant-governor. Osborne was inaugurated on
Monday, and was considerably disturbed by one passage in
the city's address to him: We are sufficiently assured that
your Excellency will be averse from countenancing, as we
from brooking, any infringements of our estimable liberties,
civil and religious." Osborne turned to Clinton and re-
marked: "I expect like treatment to that which you have
received before I leave this government." On Tuesday,
Osborne seemed gloomy. He convened the Council, and
said he was enjoined to insist upon a permanent revenue
and asked opinions as to the prospect of gaining it. The
reply was most emphatic: "The Assembly of New York
would never submit to such a demand." William Smith,
when directly appealed to by the governor, insisted: " That
no such scheme could ever be enforeed." The governor
looked sad and remarked: ''Then what am 1 sent here for?"

The next day, Wednesday, the city was startled by the
shocking intelligence that the governor had hanged himself!
The decision of the jury was that he had destroyed him-
self in a moment of insanity. DeLancey now became acting
governor, and his instructions were unqualified. He was
to insist upon **a permanent revenue, solid, indefinite, and
without limitations.*' This put De Lancey in an embar-
rassing position, inasmuch as he had most strenuously adr
vised never to give in to this very demand of the home
government. Nevertheless, he grasped the situation in a
most tactful and masterful manner. Each year the Assem-
bly passed an annual appropriation bill. De Lancey would ^
then return it, but at the same time he would secretly advise
the ministry to give in to the people. This it did finally,
September 24, 175^, through Sir Charles F^ardy, who suc-
ceeded Osborne as governor in September, 1755. Thus
through De Lancey 's tact the Assembly won a most im-
portant legislative victory.

Before bringing the account of New York during this
period to a close, reference should be nuidc to an important
event in the histor)' of educ.uiun. A bill passed the Assem-
bly on October 22, 1746, granting permission to estabhsh a
college by means of the lottery system then much in vogue.
The raising of £230 by lotteiy was the humble start of
King's College, now blown as Cdumbia University. In
November, iJS^y (vmiB thus collected were vested in a
board of trustees. In 1752, the college was enlarged hj
a gift of land from Trinity Church. In November, ^753^
Dr. Samuel Johnson, of Connecticut, was invited to be its
president, which position was accepted by him, but not until
after the passing of the charter. This took place in 1754,
and in July of the same year instruction of the youth was
begun in the schoolhouse belonging to Trinity Church.
The charter was definitely granted on October 31, 1754,
from which time the existence of the college is to be prop-
erly dated. The carl\ histnr v of the institution was marked
by an unfortunate controversy between the Presbyterians

arc! the Fpisrofxili ans. The latter attempted to secure the
supervisiot) ut the college, and as a result its supporters
were divided into two hostile parties.

In connection with the foundation of King's College, it
U'lll not be out of place to mention an event of equal
historical importance fiuni an edacational point of view
that took place in the neighboring province of New Jersey.
On OctoKer 22, 1 746, a charter was granted the College of
New Jersey, The foundation of the college was due largely
to the religious enthusiasm attending the progress of Geoige
Whitefield through the colonies* The institution was first
located at £lizabethtown,and its first president was Jonathan
Dickinson. Its Hrmest supporter in early times, however,
was Governor Jonathan Belcher. In a letter to his cousin,
William Belcher, the governor writes as follows :

"Sir — This is a fine climate and a Country of grcnt plenty
tho' but of Little profit to a Govtrnour. The inhabitants
are generally rustick and without Education. I am therefore
attempting the building of a college in the province for
Instructing the youth in the Principles of Religion in good
Literature and Manners and i iiavc a Reasonable View of
bringing it to bear.

The college was rechartered in 1748 and was soon re-
moved to Newark. In 1757 it was again removed and
located finally at Princeton. It was quite successful during
the colonial period. Money was raised by private contribu-
tions, by lotteries, and by general collections nuthon'zed by
the churches of the Presbyterian faith in Great Britain and
America. The Rev. William 1 ennent was very successful
in his efforts in behalf of the college, having collected
£it$QO in England, in addition to books and mathematical

In 1766, Governor Williani Franklin, of New Jersey,
granted a charter for a college to be called y^^*^"'^ College.
Upon this foundation Rutgers College at New Brunswick
was erected. The rtasons for its establishment were two-
fold: first, the fear of encroachments by the Church of
England ; and secondly, the difficulty of obtaining ministers

CHAPTER XV

GROITTH OF A DEMOCRA I JL tKOkiNLt, J 7 14-/734

Tbs tact which Governor Hunter diipUyed in the gov-
cmment of New Jersey brought about a friendly under*
atanding between himaelf and the Assembly. His measage
to the Assembly that convened on December 7, 1 713, re-
veals a bit of intereating flatteiy. He expressed himself as
being ^ ^ them after so long an absence, and believed
they were not sorry to "meet him in so good company/*
He urged them to support heartily the queen's government;
to provide for past arrears; to discountenance ^ ice aiul im-
mornlitv; to improve trade ; and to encourage agriculture.
He turthermore explained that the members of his Council
entertained no views or interests different from thnse of the
representatives of the people, and that all were wt iking for
the best interests of the province. He urged frequciiL and
amicable conferences betwccji the two legislative bodies as
the best means of settling the affairs of the province in a
wise and economical manner. He disclaimed any intention
on the part, of the Council to support certain disgruntled
persons in their contention that the representative legislative
body was no Assembly at all.

The reply of the Assembly was couched In the same
friendly terma aa characterized the message of the governor.
It promised to endeavor to do all in its power to bring
to a successful issue all the queen's wishes. Following
up these good intentiona, the Assembly passed a bill ena-
bling Quadcers to act aa jurors and to hold offices of trust

upi&gt;ii their solemn affirmation and declaration and exempting
them from taking the oath. Other beneficent lavvb were
passed, and the Assembly wound up its allairs to the mutual
satisfaction of itself and the governor, "I hope," said the
governor^ in his speech proroguing the AsBembly, my con-
duct hat convinced the world (I cannot suppose you want
any further conviction) that I have no other view than the
peace and prosperity of this province; if such a few as are
enemies to both, are not to be reduced by reason, I shall take
the next best and most eftctual measure to do it."

Between the years 1713 and 1716 we find nothing of
striking importance in the affairs of the province to merit
special treatment. In the conduct of his government, Gov-
ernor Hunter sought continually to bring about a better
understanding between all parties. The people wcrr not
only satisfied with bis administration, hut wcrt* c\ e]i pleased
with it. The old quarrels and grievances disappeared, and
.for a time peace and harmony prevailed.

Unfortunately, this era of good feeling was not coiuinued
altogether undisturbed to the end of Governor Hunter's
administration. Colonel Daniel Coxe was elected speaker
of the Assembly which Governor Hunter convened in the
spring of 1 716. In March, 17 10, an act had been con-
firmed designating Burlington and Perth Amboy alternately
as the places of meeting of the Assembly. In 1716, the
Assembly should have met at Burlington, but for reasons
of State the governor convened it at Perth Amboy instead.
The Assembly remonstrated against this action of the gov-
ernor as being an infringement of the law of 1710. Hunter
urged in support of his action the fact that there were cer-
tain things of great weight which made it impracticable to
hold the Assembly at Burlington at that time. The Assem-
bly allowed the matter to drop, but the harmony of the
previous three years was considerably disturbed. Coxe dis-
liked ihc governor, and used his influence to prevail upon
other members of the Assembly to oppose Hunter and the
measures he desired to have adopted.

CROff'tH Of J DEMOCRATIC PROyiNCE 371

Only nine members appeared at the meeting of the
Assembly held on May 14, 1 716, at Perth Amboy. These
nine sent a message to Hunter, urging him to adopt such
measures as would compel the attendance of the absentees.
Warrants were sent out, and as a result four others made
their appearance $ but Coxe continued to absent himself.
The governor ordered the thirteen to meet and to elect a
seigeant-at-arms, who should compel the other absent mem-
bers to attend* John Kinsey was elected speaker. In the
governor's message to the Assembly, Coxe was referred to
in the following words : " As the conduct of that gentleman
who hist filled the chair sufficiently convinced you of a
conibiiiauon between him and his associates to defeat all
the purposes of your present meeting: I hope, and cannot
doubt but it will open the eyes of all such as by his and
their evil acts, and sinistrous practices, have been misled
and iniptised upon ; so that for the future, here they will
not find it so easy a niatter to disturb the peace of the
country." The House then took up the case of the absent
members. The speaker and his associates were severally
expelled for contempt of authority and neglect of the ser-
vice of their countiy," It was furthermore decided that if
they were returned again at a new election, they should not
be permitted to hold their seats in the Assembly. Never-
theless, some of the expelled members were reelected, but,
pursuant to the action of the preceding Assembly, the)' were
not permitted to retain their seats. Coxe appealed to the
king, but was not sustained in the appeal.

In 1 7 19, Hunter was succeeded as Governor of New
York and New Jersey by William Burnet. When the
new governor visited New Jersey he found it heavily in
debt. The colony was experiencing the bad results of a
depreciated paper money, the value ot which had been ren-
dered uncertain by inflation. Nor did the Asscmbl) profit
by experience. Bills of credit were issued to the amount
of ;^40,000 for the purpose of increasing the circulating
medium of the province. Burnet continued to admmister

tbe government of New York and New Jersey until 1728,
when he was transferred to Massachusetts.

John Montgomeiy succeeded Burnet as Governor of
New York and New Jersey, April 15, 1728. During his
administration greater efforts were made to separate New
Jersey from New York. Montgomery died in office, July i,
1 73 1, and then Lewis Morris acted as Governor of New
York and New Jersey until relieved by Colonel William
Cosby in September, 1732. Immediately upon his assump-
tion of authority in New Jersey, trouble with the Assem-
bly de\clopcd. He was utterly unfit for the government
of that pri)\ incc. Men of his type were likely to drive the
colonies from the control of the mother country. If he
could not bend the judges to his way of thinking, he would
have them removed without cause. We have already re-
ferred to his quarrel with Chief Justice Lewis Morris and
the consequent removal of the latter. Likewise, we have
seen what a stir he created by reason of his new land sur-
veys and land grants. He died in 1736, and was succeeded
in the government of New Jersey by John Anderson, the
president of the Council. Anderson died about two weeks
afterward and was followed as acting governor by John
Hamilton, who was the son of Andrew Hamilton, governor
of the province in the time of the proprietors.

The separation of New Jersey from New York was first
proposed during the administration of Burnet. The question
continued to be further agitated until 1730, when a petition
was sent to the icing, urging the separation of the two prov-
inces. Another petition pressing for similar action was sent
to the king in 1736. From a maritime point of view the
separation was advisable, because New Jersey vessels were
required to be registered in New York at the cost of ^10.

to settle in New Jersey because of its dependence upon New
York. Furthermore, salaries paid to officials in New York
were spent outside of New Jersey. Very often writs were
delayed in execution, and meetings of the Council were not
held in New Jersey. Finally, the petitioners summed up
their aiguments in the following words: ^^The heart burn-
ings among the Inhabitants, and the Grievances of the
Countf}' are not known and understood, or at least never
res:arded, the governor being free from the Noise and Clam-
mor of them, at New York." The petition was granted,
and in the summer of 1738 a commission came to New
Jersey and separated that province from New York. Lewis
Morris was appuiiucd (iovernor of New Jersey. He pub-
lished his commission at Amboy on the 29th of August,
1738, and at Burlington sex era! days later.

The appointment oi Murris was received with great en-
thusiasm on the part of the popular party. Nevertheless,
he constantly comphined of the insincerity and ignorance
among the people," and objected to what he termed the
^meanest of citizens" trying to direct the government in
its afiairs. It was not long before he quarreUed with the
Assembly about money matters. That body refused to sup-
port the government, unless he acceded to its demands.
Before a compromise could be eilected, Morris died on the
2ist of May, 1746, and was succeeded by John Hamilton,
at that time president of the Council. Before a commis-
sion could be issued to a new governor, Hamilton died on
June 1 7, 1 747, and his place was taken by John Reading,
the next oldest councillor. Reading; held the office until the
summer of 1747, when Jonathan Belcher arrived as com-
missioned governor.

Belcher had been Governor of Massachusetts. He was
a scholar and a man of affairs, but his views were of the
Puritan type. He published his commission in Amboy,
but resided at Burlington for several years. He was a fol-
lower of George Whitelicld. lie refused to worship in

Sabbath. On some Sundays he could be seen driving bis
coach and four along the road to Philadelphia, there to wor-
ship in the Presbyterian church. He had scruples about
taking this drive on the Sabbath^ and soon abandoned it.
While attending commencement at the College of New
Jersey, he was seized with a paralytic stroke. Benjamin
Franldin sent him an electric apparatus which he hoped
might work a cure. Belcher never recovered from the
stroke, and died on the 31st of August, 1757. His friend,
the Rev. Aaron Burr, president of the college, preached the
funeral sermon. Although Belcher quarrelled at times with
the Assembly concerning the appropriations for the support
of the government^ yet his administration was a most suc-
cessful one. He would often say: "I have to steer between
Scylla and Charybdis; to please the king's ministers at home,
and a touchy people herej to luiF for one and bear away for
anoLher."

l"he lieutenant-governor, 1 homas Powiial!, succeeded
Belcher. Inasmuch as the former was aL the same time
Governor of Massachusetts, the active duties of the execu&gt;
tive once more devolved upon John Reading, presklent of
the Council^ until the arrival of Francis Bernard on June 15,
1758. Bernard was a Royalist, and was selected as Gov-
ernor of New Jersey by Lord Halifax. He couRed fovor
by formulating plans to enlarge the rojral power in the
colony. The most important event of his administration
was the treaty with the Indians made at Easton, Pennsyl-
vania, October, 1758. In all, five hundred and seven In-
dians — ^men, women, and childien — attended the conference.
This treaty, among other thin^, provided for a settlement
with the Indians by which they might continue to live in
New Jersey under certain restrictions. The conference
closed on the 26th of October, and the records state that
"some wine and punch were called for, and mutual healths
were drunk and the conferences were concluded with great
satisfaction.'* Bernard was removed from New Jersey
to Massachusetts in 1760, and was succeeded by Thomas

Boone. I he latter remained in office but one year, where-
upon in 1 761 he was removed to South Carolina. His
successor was Josiah Hardy, who served less thsn two
years. It bad been decidml that every American judge
shouM keep bb appomtment during the royal pleasure, but
Hardy issued a comnussion wbose term was to last during
good behavior of tbe judge. Having thus violated bis in-
structions, be was promptly dismissed in 1762; but be was
afterward appointed to die consulship at C^s, Spain. He
was succeeded in the govemorabip New Jersey by Wil-
liam Franklin, an iljeg^mate son of the great pbOosopher.
He secured his appointment through tbe influence of Lord
Bute, and was tbe last of tbe royal governors.

During this rapid succcSMon nf go vernors and the conse-
quent kaleidoscopic changes of politics, New Jersey was
rapidly developing in population and material resources. In
1738 the population was about foity-seven thousand, and
of these four thousand were slaves. Seven years later this
had increased to sixty-one thousand, making an addition for
the period of fourteen thousand people. The increase of
the population of some of the counties in West Jersey be-
tween 1^99 and 1745 was found to be more than sixfold.
The prusperity of the colony was doubtless due to the
virtuous and industrious character of the settlers. Perhaps
New Jersey's must notable progress lay in the direction of
the rapid development of its schools and churches. The
development of the two, as in New England, went hand in
hand — the Congregationalists and the Presbyterians being
the chief factors in the development of the former. The
origin of the schools may be traced undoubtedly to the
coming of the Dutch and the Swedes. During the early
period, tbe time of tbe settlers was almost entirely consumed
m defending themselves from tbe attacks of tbe Indians
and in wresting a scanty livelihood from tbe primitive soil.
As a result, the task of educating tbe youth fell to the lot
of the pastors of tbe settlements. This practically explains
the close relationship between tbe Church and the schooL

Education at that time was quite as much religious as secu-
lar. No doubt, however, many New Jersey youths attended
the Collegiate Church School founticd at New Amsterdam
in 1633, which afforded secular instruction. The first
school in New Jersey of which we have record was estab-
lished at Beigen in 1664. Engelbert Steenhuysen, a church
clerk, was the schoolmaster. Instruction was given from
eight o'clock until eleven in the forenoon, and from one
o'clock until four in the afternoon. Steenhuysen tau^t
reading, writing, spelling, and even arithmetic when the
maturity of the student's mind permitted such an intel-
lectual pursuit." The Swedes along the Delaware also
furnished secular instruction, but as their efforts to colonize
New Jersey were never successful they played but a minor
part in the instruction of New Jersey youth. Each nation-
ality in the province endeavored to confine its children to the
language of the mother countn'. The Dutch were partially
successful in thi&lt;&gt; attempt; the Swedes failed utterly. The
Bible and the Catechism were the chief sources of educa-
tional mspiration. A "little Latin and less Greek" perhaps
topped off the student's elementary knowledge. Scientific
studies were little taught, and, in fact, were even tabooed,
btcause in certain minds they were associated with witch-
craft and the occult arts.

The progress of the educational movement was greatly ac-
celerated by the coming of the Scotch and English colonists.
In 1664 we find Governor Carteret's charter to Bergen con-
taining a provision for a church and ^^free school." They
were to be supported from the proceeds realized from a
tract of land exempted from taxation. In other towns land
was set aside, the income from which was to be applied to
die support of schools. The East Jersey legislature first
made provision for education in 1693, declaring that *^the
cultivation of learning and good manners tends greatly to
the good and benefit of mankind." Towns were accorded
the privilege of electing three men, who should determine the
schoolmaster's salary and iix other rates.

Jott as fpe find tlw Congrcgatioaalttts and the Piesby-
' tmnt in East Jcfief eager to &lt;!&lt;tiblwii sclioola, to we
find sunikr good intentioot oa the |nrt of the Qnaken in
West Je«y. LegisiatiTe acts were passed for the better-
ment of the school system. One Thomas Budd advocated
a mther novel plan of education. It was compulsory at*
tendance at the ^ publick school " for seven years. His plan
was to establish such schools in all towns and cities, while
"persons of known honesty, skill, and understanding should
be yearly chosen by the governor and General Assembly to
teach and instruct boys and girls,** The curriculum was
to embrace "true English and l atin . . . reading and
fair writiiiLS ant hmu't ick, and book-icccping.** In addition^
the boys were to be instructed hi "some mystery or tiade,
as the making of mathematical instruments, joyneiy, turn-
ery, the making of clocks* and watches, weaving and shoe-
makingi" The girls, on the other hand, were to be taught
spinning in flax and wool, the knitting of gloves and stock-
ings sewing and making of all sorts of needle woik, and the
making of stmw work as hats, baskets," etc*

It must not be understood, however, that education in
New Jersey was general. Unfortunately, there was, on the
contiaiy, much illiteracy, as is proved by the letters of
the missionaries sent by the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Wherever schools were
conducted tinHrr the auspices of different sects, •I'^nnllv only
children ot that sect received instruction. Dunng the tmie
New Jersey was under royal government, no great stride
was made in the advancement of education. Prior to the
middle of the eighteenth centun', no public library existed
in New Jersey. Books were accessible only to clergy-
men and the rich. There were likewise very few news-
papers. To remedy the evils resultant upon a lack of
genetal educational facilities, private schools soon made
their appearance. The schoolmasters of these early private
schools were similar in many respects to the early Methodist
preachers. They gave instruction at the houses of their

pupils, receiving board and lodging in part payment for
their services. They usually journeyed from one locality

to another until a favorable opportunity opened the way for
their establishment in a permanent school wherein they
might, perhaps, hicatc tor the rest of their lives. Frequently
these itinerant schoulniastcis were graduates of Harvard and
Yale, and later of Princeton. Women did not teach in
schools. The rod was frequtiuly cinpluycd. The scholar
made his own pen from a goose quill, and ink was manu-
factured from vegetable products. The temperature of the
schoolroom varied little from that widiout its walls — being
hot in summer and cold in winter. ^ Much of the instruc-
tion was given by questions and answers, and woe betide the
boy who did not learn verbatim his Bible verses, although
the master might be redolent with gin when he heard the
verbatim." — (Lee, Niw Jersey as a Cokity and as a StaU^
U 35^*) education of the gjrls was sadly neglected.

A knowledge of reading and writing was considered suffi-
cient ftir all their needs. In this respect, the Quakers were
more liberal than their contemporaries. As far as higher edu-
cation is concerned, we have already noticed its beginning
in the establishment of Princeton College in i 746.

Durinii the period under consideration, the number of
churches increased rapidly uiiiil about 1765, when there
were forty-one Presbyterian churches in East Jersey and
fourteen in West Jersey, The Quakers had thirty meeting
houses in West Jersey, while the Episcopalians had twelve
churches in £last Jersey and nine in West Jersey. The
Baptists had nineteen churches, and in addition there were
churches supported by the Dutch and Swedish inhabitants
of the province. The churches were substantially built and
located in central spots, but they had neither aidoiiiments
nor embellishments. The shed for horses was an eariy and
necessar)' adjunct to the church building.

The legal profession was quite late in being placed upon
a substantial and legitimate basis. Among the earlv settlers
there was an element of unde^uable persons, adventurers

and the riffimff of £aropeaii tociety. Following clote in
their wahe came worthless lawyers, who quicUy availed
themselves of the unsettled conditioa of the times; but
in the cottise of time men of ability appeared. Those who
showed any marked degree of leg^ talent speedily reee to
distinction. It is a remarkable Act, however, that from
1704 to 1776 there were only two chief justices of New
Jersey who were attorneys licensed by thie courts of the
province. Laymen not infrequently held the office of
attorney-geneial.

The houses of the first settlers were mostly of the Dutch
type of architecture. On the exterior were the angular,
xigzag gsbles&gt; with long, projecting gutters. The stoops,
or porches, were considered necessary to the comfort of the
home. Within, a distinctive feature was the scrupulously
clean Dutch kitchen. There were no stoves, but instead
the enormous fireplace extendi plt nlrinn; the width of the
house. It was the most ch.irat u i istic teat u re of the house-
hold ecoii(ini\ of the earl\ settler. These !?ettlcrs \^•eIe a
fairlv sober class of people, indulging principally in the
drinks peculiar to the Dutch. Buttermilk and bread were
their staple food. In the winter the family collected around
the old folks at the fireplace, while in summer the young
folks sat on the stoop and chatted and gossiped to their
hearts* content. The cattle :irid pigs wandered around the
streets of the settlement ahiiost at will.

New Jersey was agricultural, and the farmer was the
dominant figure of the period. The Dutch kept their
land in a high state of cultivation. Their houses in East
Jersey were usually of stone or brick, but the homes of the
settlers along the seashore were mostly built of wood, and
those along Delaware River were for the most part of
brick. The higher classes could afibrd candles for illumina-
tion, but the average person had to be content with the
smoky and uncertain Hg^t of pine knots in the fireplace*
In the summer very little illumination was needed; the
members of the household retired soon after sunset to get

the needed fest for the arduous duties of the next day.

Carpets were a luxury, as were also wall paper and curtains,
while in all New Jersey there was probably not a bath tub.
The "best" room of farmhouses was kept dark and tight
and opened only to visitors, or when a funeral or a marriage
occurred in the family. The farmers worked hard during
the summer, but the coming of winter brought them re-
laxation. Early rising was considered one of the cardinal
virtues. Salted meat, especially pork, and vee;etables formed
the principal diet, while rum, gin, tea, and coffee afforded
them ample liquid refreshments. An icehouse was con-
sidered a luxury. Naturally, the dull monotony of the
farms soon became distasteful to the youth, who frequently
sought employment in the merchant marine or entered
counting houses in the towns and cities.

In the towns, the ubiquitous tavern was the place of
rendezvous every evening for the men. Frequently, the
keeper was a man of considerable influence in his neighbor-
hood. Sometimes he acted as an arbitrator in disputes. He
was intimate with the lawyers and was the fountain head
of information on current events and incidents around
town. He kept his eyes open for runaway slaves. The
choicest viands of the season, such as venison, bear, and
wild fowls, were served at his table. Legislative acts made
it compulsory for towns to have inns thro!ic;h which to
supply the needs of strangers. Inns were centres of drunken-
ness, swearing, and general disorder, and it became neces-
sary for the lc(_i:islature to enact a set ot restrictive acts.
Ever\ innkeeper was required to take out a license, and none
was permitted to retail more than two gallons of liquor at a
time to any one person except under a special license.

The colonists were sociable in their instincts and lively
in their manner. There were weekly evening clubs in
the village, and balls and concerts in the cities. French
influences and taste were particularly noticeable in those
parts of the province inhabited by the Huguenots. They
stimulated the growth of the Protestant religion, and brought

with them their native refinement and their love of the
beautiful. In fact, they contributed to the life of the prov-
ince those sentiments so strikingly lacking in the finglish

character of that day. It may be said that the influence of
the French was subjective rather than objective. They
contributed a romance element which appears picturesque

when contrasted with the Teutonic habits of the other
settlers. They contributed likewise their skill as craftsmen,
merchants, professional men, and scholars (Lee).




CHAPTER XVI

GROff'TH OF A ^AKER C0MM0Nff£ALTH, i;j^i7S^

During the adaunistnticm of Governor John Evans, of
Pennsylvania, the vexed question a^n arose as to whether
the Assembly had power to adjourn. The governor opposed
most strenuously the assumption of any such prerogative on
the part of the Assembly, This attempt to limit its cherished
privilege angered that representative body, and a sharp re-
monstnuice was sent the governor in the form of an address.
Inasmuch as the members were in a hurry to return to their
homes, the writing of this remonstrance was intrusted to a
committee of eight men, of which David Lloyd was chair-
man. Only two of the eight committeemen, Joseph Wil-
cox and David Lloyd, had much to do with drafting the
address. When finished, the address as a specimen of
defamatory litttaiure was indeed remarkable, tor Wikox is
said to have incorporated in it all the scurrilous and scan-
dalous reflections that he could produce. This address was
denounced by Lo^m« in a letter to Penn, as "a piece of
unparalleled villainy that needs no observation or remark
to aggravate it."

Evans was sustained by Penn in his condemnation of
the claim of the Assembly that it possessed the power to
adjourn at pleasure. Furthermore, the proprietor wrote feel*
ingly of the ingratitude of the members of the Assembly and
applied strong terms to their address. "If that letter," said
he, "be the act of the people, truly represented, it was suffi-
cient to cancel all his obligations of care over them; but

383

if k were done by particular persons assuming to act for the

whole, he expected the country would purge itself, and take
care that due satisfaction was given to him." In the spring
of I 706, Logan, in reply, wrote Penn with reference to the
intended prosecution of Lloyd: "''1 is in vain, I believe, to
attempt it; he carries so fair with our weak country-people,
and those that lung ioukcj upon hun to be the champion of
the Friends' cause in government matters in former times,
that there is no possessing them. In the Assembly the most
judicious were for having business done first, lest quar-
relling with him should prevent doing it, and throw them
into confusion $ for his party is strong as that of the wicked
and foolish."

This attack upon the proprietor aroused the indignation
of the citizens of the province, who, in spite of their deter-
mination to preserve popular power, could not forget totally
Penn's great service. For a while Lloyd seemed to lose
popularity, and there was much less noisy obstruction. The
reaction in favor of Penn was interpreted by Evans to be a
signal justification of his own conduct, and his spirit rose as
that of the Assembly sank. One of the members who had
dared to speak disrespectfully of the executive was sued and
threatened with being "kicked out" uncercniuniously. The
member pleaded his privilege, inasmuch as the offence had
been cunimitted during a session of the Assembly. The
decision of the court u as against the offender. The Assem-
bly then threatened to impeach the judges and the sherilF for
a breach of privilege. A demand of the governor for the
expulsion of the member was likewise refused, and die claim
was set forth that the Assembly could not expel a member
for words spoken outside ^of that body. The Assembly
furthermore claimed that service of a legal process on a
member for any other cause than treason, felony, or breach
of the peace was a violation of privilege" (Bolles).

Three incidents well illustrate the character of Evans
and show by what actions he first lost the support of the
people and in the end merited their contempt. He disliked

GROWTH OF A S^AKBR COMMONWEALTH 385



the religion of the Friends and was by no means careful to
disguise that dislike. Trouble soon developed as a result
of the disinclination of the Friends to enact a militia law.
Evans thought the danger from actual invasions occasioned
by the war chat had broken out between i^ iancc and S[um
would dispel the unwillingness on the part ot the Iriends
to resort to arms. There being no immediate danger of an
invasion of Pennsylvania, the artful governor thought it
advisable to create an artificial one. Following out this
determination, it is said he concocted a plan with a man
named French, of New Castle, and others, by which an
alarm of actua) invasion by the enemy was to be spread
broadcast. At the time of the holding of the annual hk at
Phihdelphia, the governor received an urgent message from
French announcing the presence of the enemies' ships in
the Delaware. The intelligence was immediately made
public. Evans mounted his horse, rushed through the
streets with drawn sword, and commanded the populace, of
whatsoever political or religious creed, to rally for the de-
fence of the province. A panic was the result. Shipping
was withdrawn from the wharves, and valuables of all kinds
were concealed. Before nightfall the ruse was discovered,
and the reaction against the authors of the false report was
so violent that they were compelled to seek safety in flieht.
The experiment, in so far as it was a test of the martial spirit
of the Friends under imminent danger of invasion, was a
ridiculous failure. They were attcinimg their religious meet-
ings at the time, and only four of their sect came out armed
ready to meet the attack of the phantom enemy.

Not content .with thus bringing his popularity to the
lowest possible ebb, Evans immediately proceeded to force
the incoming tide of popular hatred of him toward its flood.
In 1706, he erected a fort at New Castle, to protect the
river, as he claimed, but in reality, says Bolles, ^^to vex
the trade of the province." All ships navigating the Dela-
ware were required to report and pay a toll of £$ and a
fixed sum for any gun fired to compel such payment. Some

Quakers determined to tett the governor's authority tlias to
interfere with the free navigMion of the Delaware. Tbef
proceeded down the river in a vessel, and when near the
fort two of them went ashore and informed the commander
that their vessel had been regularly cleared, and requested
that they be not interfered with in their passage down the
river. This reque^^t ^vas refused; and as the vessel psfsed,
a sh&lt;^ was fired through its mainsail. This drudc action
not being successful in bringing the vessel to, the com-
mander followed in a little boat. It was a case of catching
a Tartar, for the Qiiatcors, Instead of permitting themselves
to he captured, quietly imprisoned the commander and pro-
ceeded to Salem. Evans had, in the meantime, followed
by land to New Castle and succeeded in overtaking rhe
vessel before it reached Salem. Here all fell into the custiniy
of Lord Cornbui) , w ho was ( inv cniur oi New Jersey aj» well
as of New York auU claitiicd likewise the vice-admiralty of
the Delaware in addition to his other honors. The com-
mander was taken before Cornbuiy, and that pompous
official reprimanded him. Nor did he spare Evans, who
ivas likewise the recipient of sentiments not at all of the
neighborly stamp.

The third of the actt which were particularly responsabk
for bringing Evans into contempt wiih the people was con-
cerned with the administradon of justice. Penn had sent
his eldest son, William, to America in company with Evans.
William had sown more than his share of wild oats, and his
banishment to America, where he was to reside upon an
estate of seven thousand acres presented by his father, was
an effort on the part of the latter to prevent his son and .
heir from reaping the usual plentiful han'est of tares. In in-
trusting the welfare of the young man to his old friends in
Pennsvlvania, the propru ii )r fmriklv wrote : He has wit, has
kept top companv, an&lt;l must be haiullcd with much wisdom."
For a while James Logan sucrenii J in keeping hmi uiuicr

proved more attractive and, we may add, more disastrous tor

WUliam. Evans and young Penn soon entered upon a career
of dissipation. They frequented low taverns, started un-
seemly rows in the streets, and masqueraded in female atdre.
In one of the carousals, a constable was beaten while per-
forming his duty, and the city ^ard was called out to restore
order. Young Penn was among those arrested, but £vans
escaped. The former was brought before the mayor and
reprimanded. He claimed exemption from interference on
the part of the officers; and he was supported in this con-
tention by Evans, who annulled the proceedings of the
court. The Friends were now thoroughly aroused and had
the young man indicted. The matter was dropped, how-
ever, upon the proprietor's recalling his son to England.
Evans, however, remained to witness to a still greater extent
the increasing hatred of the people.

Largely as a result, of these acts of Governor Kvans,
the tide that had been setting in toward favor of the pro-
prietor now retreated and the popular party was once more
restored to all its former powers, Lloyd was again chosen
speaker of the Assembly, and Evans was finally succeeded
as governor of the province by Charles Gookin (February,
1709). During Gookin's incumbency Lloyd continued to
be the ruling spirit among the people and was several times
elected speaiker of the Assembly. The governor had ^mild
manners and economical ways,"' and Penn therefore thought
that he might prove acceptable to the people. .He was
bom in Ireland, and, having entered the army, rose to a
captaincy in Earle's Royal Regiment. The colonists called
him "Colonel." No sooner had he put his foot upon the
soil of Pennsylvania than he was petitioned for a redress of
grievances. Nor did the victorious popular party stop at
this negative way of showing their dislike for Evans. The
former governor was charged with high crimes and mis-
demeanors, and demands were made for his criminal prose-
cution. Gookin claimed he had no authority to proceed
to such radical measures. He became more than ever de-
pendent on the Assembly for support, and under Lloyd's

leadership that body took advantage of the needs of the
governor, to extend its own powers. As a result of this
policy of the governor, an unusual harmony between him-
self and the Assembly was maintained, at least outwardly,

for several years. This happy state of affairs was not des-
tined to continue to the end of the governor's administra-
tion. He lost popularity by neglecting to punish some
rioters who tried to prevent the arrest of a clergyman in-
dicted for a serious offence; also, by iinLipreting a Parlia-
mentary statute in such a way as to discjualify (fakers
from giving evidence in criminal cases, from serving on a
jury, and from holding office. Purtherniorc, cvidcncci) of
mental infirmity made their appearance. The governor
accused Isaac Norris, Mayor of Philadelphia and speaker
of the Assembly, and James Logan of being disloyal to the
English government and well-disposed toward the cause of
the pretender James. The Council asked for the govemor^s
recall, and a successor arrived in May, 1717. Gookin
could not prove his charges against Norris and Logan and
was compelled to withdraw them most ignominiously, as-
cribing his conduct to mental weakness. Gookin's successor
was Sir William Keith. During Keith's rule the quarrels be^
tween the executive and legislative bodies were much fewer.
The people were too busily engaged in their own private
affairs to pay much attention to politics, and the Assembly
was not well attended. Nevertheless, for this very reason
the control of the Assembly fell into the hands of a few
bold and fearless leaders of the opposition, of whom David
Lloyd was for years the acknowledged leader. Lloyd died
in 1731.

Keith was the tirst and last governor of Pennsylvania to
possess a tide. He was a Scotchman, without fortune, and
probably sought the governorship of Pennsylvania for the
money he thought he could get out of it. During Queen
Anne's reign he had been appointed surveyor-general of
customs for the American colonies. Having lost that posi-
tion upon the accession of George L, he turned a covetous

tyc towsrd Penntjrlvania* Haniidi Penn wu finally per-
suaded to appoint him governor on the recommenditions
of the Provincial Council^ of William Penn the Younger,
and of Secretary Logan. This support was seconded like-
wise hf the chief inhabitants of Philadelphia and their Lon-
don fiiends. She was probably also influenced by Keith's
professed interest in the proprietor's affairs*. She said of
him in a letter to Logan : ^He has g^ven me such assurance
of his care and zeal in our affairs as give us room to hope
you may safely consult with him for your own ease and our
benefit in cases of property,"

Keith had hardly been settled in his new position, when
news came of the approaching end of the proprietor. Wil-
liam Penn was then ( i 7 1 H) over seventy-three years old, yet
had partially recovered from the first stroke of paralysis,
which had in a measure dethroned his reason. A second
and a third stroke now followed in rapid succession, and the
great proprietor was laid low. He had left his home in Rush-
combc-near-tlie-sea for a visit to Bristol on July 27, 1 7 18.
His hard labors in his province and in England now pro-
duced their legitimate results. The treatment he had re-
ceived from those who owed almost everything to him and
the wildness of his son William had quite broken his spirit.
Early on the morning of the 28th of July, Penn died. He
was buried at Jordans.

Whatever view we may hold with regard to Penn's gov-
ernment of his province, we must admire his stead^tness of
character and his ^^unflinching devotion to what he believed
to be the hi^est truth." The prospective loss of powerful
friends at court and the loss of high social and political
honors which it was in their power to bestow did not cause
him to flinch in the slightest degree from the performance
of a dutv for which he felt divinely called. Perhap*; the best
estimate of his character is that given fn the f^bituui) mcni«&gt;~
rial issued bv the Friends of his own monthly meeting.

in conversation, yet weighty and serious — of an extraor-
dinauy greatness of mind, yet void of the stain of ambition;
as free from rigid gravity as be was clear of unseemly levity;

a man — a scholar— a friend; a minister surpassing in specu-
lative endowments, whose memorial will be valued by the
wise, and blessed with the just."

Penn's " Holv Fxperiment** was the " most ideal political
experiment ever attempted.'* It was a realization of some
things ot which Harrington in his OceanOy Plato in his
Republic^ and More in his Utopiu^ never dreamed. From a
material point of view the experiment was a most decided
success. Had it been possible tor Penn to continue to
reside in the province, the many troubles and dissensions
to which we have had occasion to refer, and which un-
doubtedly retarded the growth of the colony, might never
have arisen. Penn himself never made a truer statement
than when he said: ^Though good laws do well, good men
do better; for good laws may be abolished or evaded by ill
men; but good men will never want good laws, nor sufier
ill ones." During Penn's absences those who were evilly
disposed toward him took every advantage, and even his
friends allowed the interests of the province to be assailed
too often by reason of their own selfishness and quarrel-
some disposition. His policy- of friendliness and kindness
toward the Indians was a signal success, from whatever
point of view we examine it. However unseliish his career,
his character has not altogether escaped attacks by Macaulay
and Franklin. Macaulay was undoubtedly in error; and
Franklin, by reason of his practical cast of mind, was never
in a position to judge the motives of an idealist such as
Penn was in very many respects. The purity of his motive
cannot be impugned, even though one may notice here and
there evidences of self-interest.

Pennsylvania was prosperous from the very beginning of
its settlement. Even those settlers ^ho were most out-
spoken in accusing Penn of harshness were more successful
in material afiairs than their contemporaries in the other

colonies* Penn's province was more widely, better known
in Europe than any of the other colonies* Consequently, a
more cosmopolitan population settled within its boundaries.
At the time of Penn's death the population had reached, ap-
proximately, fifty thousand, and Philadelphia had taken such
strides that it was then the largest city on the continent*
This growth made Pennsylvania one of the most prosperous
of the English colonies in America.

Penn left a widow and six chiidren-^^ son and a daugh*
tor by his first wife, and three sons and a daughter by his
second. His land was encumbered by a mortgage, and he
had entered into an agreement with the crown for the sale
of his proprietary rights. His will had been made prior to
this agreement. His English and Irish estates he devised to
his son William and his daughter Lrfitia Anhn \ — rliiKlrcn
by his first wife, Guliclma Maria Sprmgeit. i hese cstares
returned an annual revenue of ^1,500 and wcrr cuuiued
far more valuable at that time than his possessions in the
New World. To his Widow and her children he left his
Anu rican possessions after his debts were paid out of them.
To the Earls ut Oxford, Mortimer, and Pawlet he liUrusted
the government of ihc province and Lower Counties, to be
sold by them to the crown or to any other prospective pur-
chaser. They were given authority likewise to place upon
the market as much land as might be necessary for the com-
plete satisftction of his debts* His daughter Letitia and
the three children of his son William were made recipients
of ten thousand acres of land each. His widow was ap*
pointed the sole executrix and legatee of the estate, and the
remainder of the lands in America were to be g^ven to her
children at her discretion and subject to an annuity to herself
of £$00,

Sevend vexed questions now arose concerning the nature
of the government under the will. As between the respec-
tive ri^ts of the crown, the heir-at-law, and the widow in
the government of the province, the whole question was so
. thoroug^y muddled that the trustees would not assume the

responsibility of acting. They consequently appealed to
the Couit of Chanceiy to determine thdr rights. For this
purpose an action was begun that was not decided until
1727. In the meanwhile, Penn*s widow assumed the direc-
tion of the provincial affairs until the decision was rendered
estnhltshing the proprietary's will. The emhr\ onic agree-
ment with the crown was not sustained, and in conscrjucnce
the proprietary rights devolved first on William Pcnn the
Younger. At his death tliev devolved on his son Springctt
conjointly with John, Thonuis, and Richard, the three sons
of the proprietor's second wife, Hannah Callowiuil.

Soon after Keith's arrival in the province^ he met the
Assembly of the Lower Counties at New Owtle. Throu^
the exercise of considerable tact he was successful in brush-
ing aside the haze that had hltheito clouded the proprietary's
claim to the government of that territory. The legality of
that title was now unreservedly admitted by those most
interested. The settlement was indeed most opportune, for
by reason of the disputed title to governmental prerogatives
and of the errors of the preceding governors a movement was
on foot to petition the crown for the appointment of a royal
governor. Fresh from his successful negotiations with the
Assembly of the Lower Counties, Keith proceeded to Phila-
delphia, more confirmed than ever in his ciLtcnniiKition to
be a tactful and politic executive. Here he made his first
address to the Assembly of the province. This address is
so thoroughly typical of the character of the man, and so
well illustrative of the character of his entire administration,
that we cannot rcham from quoting portions of it at sunic
length. The portions selected will not be given verbatim,
but in the paraphrased form in which they have been quoted
by BoUes in his Pitmsyhania (i, 232):

He announced *^his tender regard for their interests. He
should always endeavor to make the time they must neces-
sarily bestow on the public service as easy and pleasant to
them as he hoped it would be profitable and satisfactoiy
to the country. The warmth of his inclination towards

them might be Inferred fiom his application during the
last year, to introduce to the prince regent the humble
address of the Assembly to the king, which had been so
graciously received by his exertions; by the diligence and
expense with which he bad obtained his commission, with-
out other prospect or advantage than that of serving them ;
and by the fatigue he had already undergone to prc^mote
their service. But these things were trifles compared with
their indispensable obligation to support the dignity and au-
thority of the government, by such a reasonable and discreet
establishment as the nature of the thing and their own gc n-
erosity would direct; and whatever they might be disposed
to do of that kind, he hoped might no longer bear the unde-
served and reproachful name of a burthen on the people;
but that they would rather enable him to relieve the country
from real burthens, by empowering him to introduce a better
economy and more fru^ management in the collection of
taxes, which were then squandered by the oiBcers appointed
to assess and collect them,'*

Keith was quite as successful in his dealings with the
Indians, from- the very beginning of his administration, as he
had been with the people of the province. He visited the
Governor of Virginia, and together they drew up an agree-
ment with respect to certain boundary disputes with the
Indians that were threatening to become serious. The
agreement proved satisfactory to the Indians of Pennsvlva-
nia and of the iv c Nations, and was ratified at Concstoga,
Keith showed his insight into the Indian character and illus-
trated his tact and diplomacy by using all the pomp and
ceremony he could devise. He set out upon the journey
accompanied by seventy horsemen, with the intention of
impressing the natives. He was altogether successful in his
mission.

Keith's great popularity made it possible for him to float
another important measure, a militia law. This had always
been repugnant to the Assembly, which had constantly op-
posed militaiy measures $ but there was now a rteal and

pressing need of it, since the French were mpidl^ encroach-
ing upon Pennsylvania territory. These encroachments of
the French were such that in 1732 it was revealed that they
cbimed all the territory drained by rivers and streams whose

mouths were in their territory. It is interesting to speculate
as to the real causes of Keith's unprecedented popularity
during the first year of his administration. We find him
always on the side of the people, always lenient toward the
Quakers, decidedly favorable to rigid religious codes, and
always friendly disposed toward the Indians. These were
undeniable virtues, and no doubt sufficiently account for his
popularity. The other governors had invariably cast their
lots with the proprietors, either from political motives or from
a btnct sense of loyalty and of obligation to their employers.
But Keith, mediuting upon the shortness of the administra-
tions of his predecessors and the turbulence of their official
careers, determined to profit by their unhappy experiences.
Consequently, from the first he posed as friend and pro-
tector of the people. His rule, in consequence, was longer
than those of his predecessors, but his end proved to be also
more disastrous — with one possible exception.-

Kelth succeeded where both Evans and Gookin had S^^-
nally failed. He convinced the Assembly that a court of
equity was a necessity and that he himself as governor
could lawfully perform the duties incident to the office of
chancellor.

During the administration of Keith's predecessors the
criminal jurisprudence of the province had been allowed to
drop Into a condition of chaos. Murderers had been allowed
to escape, or had been kept in prison for years without
being brought to trial. During Gookin's administration
two murderers had been allowed to escape bv reason of the
governor's denial oi the qualihcatiun oi juiymcn who would
not take the oath to sit in judgment of capital cases. The
boast was made that these murderers could not be tried on
a capital charge. Nevertheless, Keith showed commends
able vigor in having them indicted and tried. They were

convicted and sentenced to death by a jury, eight of which
were Quakers, Finally, the colony became thoroughly
alarmed at this critical condition of affairs, and the Assem-
bly became eager to obtain any regular administration of
justice consistent with its fundamental rights. At the sug-
gestion of Keith, an act was passed adopting those penal
Statutes of England best adapted to the existing needs of
the province. This act likewise contained a provision se-
curing the riglit of affirmation to those who were conscien-
tiously opposed to taking an oath. In addition to unnatural
crimes, high and petit treason, murder and manslaughter,
&lt;^ witchcraft and conjuration," robbery and burglary, rape
and arson, malicious maiming, and every other felony except
larceny, were declared to be capital on a second conviction.
The province continued under the English criminal code
until after the War of the Revolution, when it returned to
the more humane code set forth by Penn.

It must not be lost sight of that Penn had established a
most admirable criminal code in the first year of the prov-
ince. This body of laws had as its fundamental principle
the reformation of the criminal rather than his punishment,
and was far in advance of any criminal law of that time.
These laws were "animated by tlie spirit of philanthropy,
and the punishments were designed to tie up the hands of
the criminal i to retorin and repair the wrongs of the in-
jured party i and to hold up an object of terror sufficient
to check a people whose manners he endeavored to fashion
by provisions interwoven in the same system." Tlie only
capital offence was wilful and premeditated murder. Hie
oflfences, in great number, for which death was exacted in
Great Britain at the time were not capital in Pennsylvania.
Such, for instance, were robbery, burglary, arson, rape,
unnatural crimes, forgery, and treason of all degrees. Im-
prisonment at hard labor, flogging, fines, artd forfeitures
were inflicted upon offenders, with varying severity depend-
ing upon the degree of the crime. Even a premeditated
murderer could not be convicted except upon the testimony

of two wttnettes. After conviction, execution was stayed
until the executive had had the opportunity of carefully le-
vtewing the case. Should he deem it advisable, he could
pardon the offender or commiitc the punishment.

The provisions of Pcnn's charter required that all laws
enacted by the Assembly should be transmitted to England
within five years for the royal approval or veto. The
queen in Council vetoed every one of the provisions of
Penn's criminal cuJc. 1 he Assembly, however, rcenacted
and enforced them, and for a wlulc the English autiiurities,
for some reason or other, seemed to connive at this defiance
of authority. Then came the period of confiition during
the adminittntion of Gookin, which was ushered in by the
repealment of the laws permitting affirmation in the place
of taking oaths. This was the lesult of a kw, passed during
the first year of the reign of Geoige L, declaring that no
person could qualify for office or take part in criminal pri^
ceedings except upon taking an oath. As a result, judges
belonging to the Society of Friends refused to sit in crimi-
nal cases, and, because from the Friends most of the judges
were chosen, the administration of justice was practically

suspended.

One of Keith*s laws permitted the wives of men at sea
to take legal action as if unmarried. Certain municipal
regulations were alsn enacted requiring the appointment of
city surveyors. Thcbc officials were to decide upon certain
building regulations and were intrusted with the responsi-
bility of having them enforced. Thcic is one act of Keith's
that brought him considerable popularity at the time, but that
must now be condemned as the most pernicious policy of
his whole administration. He first initiated the colonists
into the mysteries of a paper currency. Not that the dis*
credit should be laid solely at his door — it was an epidemic
that was destined to take possession of the province in
time, just as it had of Massachusetts more than thirty years
before, and just as it did every one of the thirteen colo-
nies before the overthrow of the English rule. But Keith

led the way auul advited the introductioii of the fiat money,
thinking it would supply the woeful lack of a metallic cur-
rency and thus cause the wheels of tndustiy to move rapidly
where hitherto they had been seriously clogged. The lack
of a supply of money sufficient to meet the Intimate de-
mands of a growing commerce had indeed become a most
serious question. Specie had been so scarce from the he-
gaming of the settlement of the colony, that the people
were compelled to use the products of the soil for pay-
ing their debts. By an act of the Assembly, wheat, lye,
Indian corn, barley, oats, pork, beef, and tobacco, as in
other colonic?, were made legal tender at their market
prices. Even taxes were made payable in product at c ur-
rent local rates, and the proprietary quitrents might be paid
in wheat bv special arr uiLt iiu nt with the proper authorities.
As the colony grew, this mcthoti of barter became embar-
rassing and awkward am! the whole commercial system
became tlisarraJigcd. 1 here were some coins in circulation,
but their value was by no means stable and their quantity
was exceedingly limited. To relieve the situation, sooae
of the cokmiea had already resorted to the printing press.
Massachusetts was the fint to issue paper money, taking
the initiitive in 1690. By Keith's time the question in
Penn^lYania had become the all-important one, and the
gOTCfnor was never averse to tickling die ^popubr fancy.'*
He considered the time ripe for a popubf move on his part,
and recommended the Assembly to consider the expediency
of adopting a paper money system*

Two men in the province, however, were wise enough
to appreciate the dangers from the financial heresy. James
Logan and Isaac Norris both opposed the issuance of paper
money, and transmitted to the Assemblv their reasons for
their opposition. They opposed the plan on the {jround
of its probable disapproval by the Privy Council, beemg,
however, the determination of the people to have paper
money at any cost v\ hatsot ver, these two men next did their
best to render the movement as harmless as possible. They

suggested that the sum issued should be small, sufficient
to pass from hand to handj" that it should continue in cir-
culation no longer than five years if not approved by the
crown ; and that its final retirement should be absolute, and
justly and equitably provided for by a well-devised sinking
fund. Keith replied to these objections, at the same time
stating his reason for supporting the plan. Popular senti-
ment was with the governor, and a system of paper currency
was shortly matured.

Of the 1 5,000 in bills of credit first issued, ,/*2,500
went toward the payment of the public debt, j6 1,500 was
disfributnl to some of the counties as a loan; and the re-
mauiJcr was lent to individuals at interest and on certain
approved security. All the last- mentioned loans were
secured by sterling plate or real estate. The maximum
period before maturity of the loans on plate was one year
and on lands eight years, and the interest demanded was
four per cent. The amount of the loans could not be less
than £1% or more than £100* There was one exception
made to this rule — if all the biUs had not been lent four
months after the opening of the loan office, the former
applicants could increase their borrowings to a maximum
of £200. The kinds of land that might be offered as
security for a loan were carefully defined by the laws.
Failure to liquidate within two months after the maturity
of an instalment subjected the borrower to be proceeded
against by the province for the absolute possession of the
security thus forfeited. All bills were to be destroyed upon
their return to the loan office. The act contained a legal
tender provision, and all persons who refused to accept the
bills at their par value in full payment of all debts in real
and personal estate transactions were fined. The loan
office was in charge of four trustees, and the bills wcic
signed by persons specified in the act. The workmanship
of the bills was so poor and crude that they were counter-
feited almost immediately. Many of the counterfeits were
made in Ireland, and the counterfeiters carried on a most

remunerative business. A law was passed making the penalty
for counterfeitiiig the clipping of ears, flogging, and fine,
which, if not paid, made the offender liable to be sold for a
period of seven years to anyone who would pay for his labor.
Of course, this did not stop counterfeiting, and in 1753 the
punishment was made "death, without beneht of tiergy."

To keep the paper currency out of the hands of the specu-
lators, the act provided that the lands could not be divided
and that no fictitious titles could be created. Every proper
precaution was taken to protect the currency, both in the
examination of titles and in the rigid adherence to the pro-
visions of the law governing loans to individuals. The loans
made to the province toward the payment of the public debt
were to be liquidated from the customs and excise tax. The
counties were to repay their loans from the proceeds of an
annual tax of a penny a pound added to the customaiy
county rate. Within a few months the thing happened
that usually characterizes the issuance of bills of credit.
The bills were so popular that ^^30,000 more were soon
emitted, under an act which extended the maximum period
of maturity to twelve years. Stmic few changes were made
in the provisions of this second act, but in ail essential
principles the changes were unimportant.

Logan, as we have seen, protested vigorously against the
issuance of paper money, and atter that measure had been
passed he watched the results with keen interest. Although
he had ceased to be a member of the Council, he was still
clerk of that body and secretary of the province. He and
the governor watched each other closely, knowing full well
that a conflict between them was inevitable and that open
hostilities might be precipitated at any moment. An error
on the part of Logan furnished the governor with the
opportunity which he had been eagerly awaiting for some
time. The former assumed the personal responsibility of
inserting in the minutes of the Council an account of its
proceedings which had not been formally approved. Keith
thereupon removed him from his office. The afiiur did

not rest there, for I^ogan went to England and complained
to Mrs. Pcnn of what he considered his bad treatment.
Mrs. Penn had always had the utmost confidence in the
sccretaiy and was considerably exasperated at the governor's
action. She wrote to Keith and accused him of neglecting
the proprietary interests, and threatened his removal unless
he mended his ways. He was ordered peremptorily to rein-
sute Logan in his office and to put him in possession of the
seal of the province.

Two of the trustees sent Keith a letter, in which they
strongly disapproved of his recent behavior and told him
that his remaining in office depended altogether on his
compliance with the instructions he had received from
Mrs. Penn. This letter did not mince matters, but was
concise, frank, and right to the point. It was a stinging
rebuke to the [governor. "The care of the Province," they
wrote, " devolving m some measure upon us as trustees, we
have been obliged to consider the late conduct in it, which
has been so far from giving content to the Friends, who
expected a very different account of it, that we mieht have
very justly proceeded to a change. But the widnw of our
worthy triend, our deceased proprietary, is still willing thou
mayest have further trial, and be continued longer ^ the only
terms of which are thy strict compliance with the instructions
given in the foregoing letter. Thou mayest suppose, per-
haps, that the powers of government are not directly lodged
by the will in our said friend, the widow i and, therefore,
that it may not belong so immediately to her to direct in
afiairs of government; but, as the interest of the family is
principally concerned in the welfare and prosperity of that
Province, it can become no other person better to take care
of it ; and if ever the propriety of this proceeding be ques-
tioned, thou mayest easily be convinced, there is sufficient
power to end all disputes with thee about it."

Keith was not the man to act supinely in an affair where
his own personal pride was involved. He sent a spirited
reply to Mrs. Penn, in which he justiiied his acts, although

at the nme time he tactfully profeMcd his readinets to
ohejr all kgal instmcdons. Fiuthermore, he maintained
most vigorously his ri^ts as governor to act in certain
matters independently of the proprietaiy. Nor did he allow
the matter to rest there. He sent all the correspondence
to the Assembly, including Mrs. Penn's instructions and
his own letter in reply. Logan replied to Keith by a me-
morial in which he presented the arguments of the dissent*
ing members of the Council. That body, as a whole,
however, was on the side of Keith and considered his cause
their own cause. Logan';? memorial aroused the latent ire
of David Lloyd, which had until then been sleeping peace-
fully under the dignified robes of the chief justiceship. The
"agitator," Logan's ancient adversary, threw off all official
dignity and came to the tk fence of popular rights. He
adduced proof after proof that in the exercise of his pre-
rogatives the governor was totally unresponsible to the
Council. Keith was completely sustained by the Assembly,
and Mrs. Penn was uiformed of the fact by letter. Keith
was furthermore pledged the support of the Assembly in
resisting the proprietary's specific instructions (Bolles).

The usual reaction set in shortly afterward. Keith and the
Assembly had gone a step too far, and none realized the fact
better than the members of that legislative body. Rumors
of Keith's early removal became rife, and his popularity
lessened in direct proportion to the credibility of those
rumors. Those whose object it was to be always on the
winning side deserted him at once. They were soon fol-
lowed by others, until the stampede to the proprietary side
became general. As the ultimate fate of the governor de-
veloped into a certainty, the members of the Assembly
treated him with coldness or, worse, with indifference. He
now underwent the usual experiences of a popular hero fallen
iium favor. His unpopularity became as great as had been
his popularity in the palmy days of his prosperity. Even
those whom he had served most faithfully, and for whom
he had risked the breach with the proprietaiy, turned ag^st

him when they were convinced that the end of his power
was at hand. The AsseniMy refused him anything more
than a half-hearted vote of confidence. His stipend for
the current year was cut more than in half, and the £^00
that the Assembly allowed him was voted in a grudging
manner.

Keith was finally removed in 1726, after having been in
office more than nine years. He clung to the hope that he
would be ultimately recalled, and as there were still many
of the colonists who suppui ud lum liis hopes were not w ith-
out seeming foundation. He became the centre of the oppo-
sition to the new administradoAy and let no opportunity pass
without adding to its difficulties. He was elected to the
Assembly, and at first exerted considerable influence upon
its deliberations. Later, however, upon the exposure of
what were supposed to be his ulterior motives, either to
secure his reappointment or the overthrow of the proprietary
government, his influence was reduced to almost zero.

Keith's sole ambition was to be popular, and he tried to
accomplish this in every way possible, either by fair or foul
means. He made promises when cornered which he knew
he could not keep. This plan for a while proved success-
ful, but in the end brought about his ruin. Success turned
his head so complete) v that he fancied himself not only
superior to Logan in ability but even more powerful than
the proprietary itself. His disputes with Logan brought
about his downfall, and after his sceptre had departed his
popularity soon folio wed.

Ke ith remained in the province until the spring of 1728,
wlK-n he was obliged to leave secretly to avoid prosecution
for debt, into which his lavish style of living had involved
him. Shortly after his return to England, he published a
pamphlet on the state of the colonies. He is said to have
been the first person to suggest to the crown the advisability
and practicability of taxing the American colonies. This
was in 1 739. A sad end overtook the ex-govemor. He died
in the Old Bailey, where he had been imprisoned for debt.

GRUtt^lH OF A }^JK£R COMMON tVEALlH 403

Huvvtvcf severely we may condemn Keith's personal
failings, we are compelled to recognize the tact that the
colony prospered under his zealous support of the popular
party as h had never prus^iered before. He has been con-
deouied aeveiely — and justly to — by Pennsylvania historians
for his treacherous conduct of the proprietaiy's interest
in the province. But in their eagerness to bbu:ken his
chancter, they have £uled either to give him the little
personal credit that is due or to recognise the beneficent
results of his alliance with the popular paity. Keith un«
doubtedly had selfish interests to serve in assuming the
championship of the popular cause, but we cannot believe
that his attitude toward that cause was one totally devoid
of principle. He was ambitious, he was selfish, and he was
not always particular as to the means he adopted to accom-
plish his ends; hut his faults were committed in the defence
of the popular rights rather than in thi.- enhancement of the
aristocratic power. That fart docs not by any means excuse
his errors, but it docs put him in a relatively better light
when he is compared with other colonial governors who
shared his faults but, unlike him, did nothing for the cause
of popular government.

Patrick Gordon, who succeeded Keith (i 726), was most
successful in winning the respect of the people. He had
been a soldier in the English army and had served from his
youth to the close of Queen Anne^s wars. He was bom
in the same year as William Penn, 1 644, and had fought in
Europe at a time when the English annies were commanded
by Mailboroi^. In his first address to the Assembly, he
assured the members that the frankness acquired in the
camps would be continued in the executive chair* He dis-
claimed any intention of resorting to refined or artful"
politics in the discharge of his duties and reiterated his deter-
mination to be candid in all his dealings with the Assembly.
As Keith profited by the mistakes of his predecessors, so, as
the sequel proved, (jordon profitr ci by the errors of Keith.
He restored the Council to its former prerogatives and struck

a happy balance between the interests of the proprietaries
and those of the people. In fact, he tried to make the two
seemingly conflicting interests identical. Soon after Gordon
became governor, news was received of the death of the
kinp: ; and the Assembly sent a congratulatory address to his
8ucc( sHor, George 11.

Shortly afteru'ard, Gordon addressed a communication to
the Assembly on the subject of biik uf credit. The five years*
limit having been reached, the paper money acts were sub-
mitted to the Privy Council. Tlie Committee of the Coun-
cil on Trade and Plantations had warned the Penntylvania
Assembly of the dangers incident to its paper money policy.
Nevertheless, in recoginttion of the fact that the currency had
already become widely circulated among the people, permis-
sion was given to continue it temporarily* It was specifically
understood, however, that no further issues should be made
and that all outstanding bills should be withdrawn as rapidly
as possible. Gordon agreed entirely with the point of view
of the committee, until by actual observation of the opera^
tion of the currency in Pennsylvania he was led to change
his opinions. He then expressed his belief that the bills of
credit had been a benefit both to the province and to England.
Importations from England had greatly increased ; more
ships had been built j and the currency itself, far from depre-
ciating in value as it had in the other colonies, had actually
risen in value. He showed, likewise, that the drain of gold
and silver to England had been somewhat checked by the
establishment of iron furnaces and by the cultivation of
hemp; that these, likewise, would enhance the value of the
paper money and make it secure imtil it could be dispensed
with altogether. For this reason, he thought the Privy
Council would overlook any little breach of its instructions.

In fact, there was already a noisy demand for another
issue of the currency. The colonists thought it a great
convenience to trade, and credited the existing stagnation
of business to the fact that many of the bills had been
redeemed and that the supply was not equal to the drain

of gold and sflver to Eng^nd. Merchants were oveistocked
with goods, navigation WM diaooitnged, and thipjrardt were

idle. The Assembly prepared an address to the Privy
Council, in which the old aigMments in favor of paper
money were repeated and the specific plea entered that
Pennsylvania was not like other colonies; that PennsyU

vania had secured the hills by requiring the pleHging; of
valuable concrete* prc&gt;pert\-; that the issues were nut made
solely 01; the credit of the (:;r)\ emment, a&lt;; had been done in
other colonies. I hc Assembly thereupon prepared a bill
rcissumg the amounts already authorized and adding an issue
of ;^30,ooo to be repayable by instalments in sixteen years.
The whole sum current thus became ^^75,000, and the last
issue was to continue current until 17 59.

In 1733, William Pcnn's second wife, Hannah, died.
Penn's estate at the time of his death had been so greatly
ledboed that liii widow^t last days were clouded by the lack
of suiBcient means lo live according to her station. Wtl*
liam Pton's grandson Springett, son of William Penn, Jr.,
had died two years before (173 1 ), and Dennis in 1722, The
Assembly then questioned Gordon's authority to act as
governor. However, a new commission was sent him,
sigpied by John, Robert, and Richard Penn, in whom the
government was then vested. The appointment was ap&gt;
proved by the crown, which, however, reserved the right to
govern the Lower Counties on the Delaware. John Penn,
known as the ^^American,*' because he was bom in Philadel-
phia during the founder's second visit, came out to the colony
during the administration of Gordon. He returned m a few
months to checkmate f^ord Baltimore, who was planning a
settlement of the disputed boundary between Maryland and
Pennsylvania altogether in his own interests. Thomas Penn
resided m the colony from 1732 to 1741 and was a member
of the Council. By reason of his n.irrow and somewhat
selhsh policy, he failed to win the esteem of the people.

Governor Gordon died in August, 1736, in the ninety-
sccond year of his age. The ten years of his administration

had been a dccaJt; ui peace and prosperity. Personally, he
was able to say that the oftener he met the Assembly, the
more their confidence in each other was increased." The
governor was heM in the hig^st esteem by both the people
and the proprietary. His frankness had commanded the
regard of lU. ^The dissension between the proprietafy
and popular parties was scarce remembered; the unanimity
of the Assembly, the Council, and the goyemor, gave an
uninterrupted course of prosperity to the Province. During
this period the colony incroMed greatly sn popuhtion and
in wealth."

Another governor was not appointed for two years. Dur-
ing that prriod, James Lop-nn, as president of the Council,
acted in the place of the executi \ e. Few matters ot impor-
tance characterize Logan's exercise of the executive func-
tion, except the boundary dispute with Maryland. This
dispute was more than seventy-five years old and now cul-
minated in a quarrel accompanied by some bloodshed. A
detailed account of the dispute will be given in the succeed-
ing chapter, on the " Development of Maryland." Logan
had never been beloved by the people of the province* They
claimed that he had always been opposed to their inter-
ests and favorable to those of the proprietary. We might
have expected a reasonably tumuhuous interregnum as a
result of Logan's accession to power. But such was not
the case. The two years passed with scarcely a ripple
upon the sur&amp;ce of the provincial waters, ^The annals
of the time consist of those dull, ordinary events that are a
true indication of a people's happy existence.**

The state of the province upK&gt;n the arrival of the new
governor, George Thomas, in 1 738, is an interesting con-
trast to what it was at the meeting of the Assembly in
1682. Great changes had come to the colony during the
years that had intervened. At the first settlement of the
province, the people were profoundly grau tu! to Penn for
the haven he had afforded them hom the religious persecu-
tion of the mother country. In 1 738, however, Penn was

dead and the regard which had been shown for him and his
family had disappeared. In its place had grown up indif-
ference and even disregard, while the Assembly felt under
no obligation to anyone for anything. The supremacy of
the people was thoroughly established. The representatives
made the laws and consulted no interest 'other than that of
the people.. The only check to the Assembly's complete
control of all legislative matters was the veto power of the
governor and the Privy Council.

This condition of affairs was due to the fact that genera-
tions that knew not Penn or his family had sprung up in the
province. The attractions the colony had to offer, reli-
gious, political, and material, were such that wave after
wave of emigrants came from many countries of Europe.
Most of them had never heard of Penn, and those who had
heard of him did not cherish any particular sentiments with
respect to him or his family. They knew of no reason
why thev should act differently toward his family than they
did toward others of the proprietary class. Ry far the most
numerous of the people who finally settled in Pennsylvania
were the (lermans. We have already recurred to the fact
that the Germans, oppressed and persecuted at home, learned
with delight from Penn of his project to found a colony
where all should be free. Most of tlicni came to Penn-
sylvania, and prominent among them was Francis Daniel
Pastorius, who, as agent of the Frankfort Land Company,
composed of wealthy persons, chiefly Pietists, in Germany
and Holland, settled a colony at Germantown in 1683.
After that, the number of German settlers increased rapidly,
many of them coming from Heidelberg. They knew more
about Pennsylvania, because Pastorius had written concern-
ing the colony in his circulars, which had been spread broad-
cast throughout the old country. Profiting by the unhappy
experience of the Palatine Germans during the administration
of Governor Hunter, many of the later emigrants avoided

nonites, persecuted at their homes in the cantons of Zurich,

Bern, and Schatihauscn, went to Alsace ui 1072. Later,
they came to Pennsylvania, where they settled on land now
a part of Lancaster County. They were afanikr in rdig^tit
belief to the Friends. Many Moravians also came from
Gcorgpa at the beginning of the Spanish war« ornig to the
fiict that their religion forbade theur taking up arms. Many
German emigrants settled in Bucks, Berks, Mootgomeiy,
Lancaster, and York Counties. By the time of the Revolu-
tion, they had spread over a very considerable portion of the
province, but the centre of the German population was in
Berks and Lancaster Counties.

For the most part, the Germans were very friendly dis-
posed toward the Oiiakers. They always expressed their
gratitude for the kintincss and protection they bad received
at their hands. Thev claimed they had not experienced
ctiually kind and liberal treatment in any other English
colony. Consequently, when it came to a political contest,
the Gcnnaiis always voted in support of Quaker control
when the strtiggle assumed the character of an anti-Quaker
movement. Governor Thomas, on the contrary, always
maintained that this support of the Germans was won by
the Quakers* representing that the militia Uw was well
calculated to reduce them to the slavery they had expe-
rienced in their own country and from which they had so
happily escaped; furthermore, that this militia law, which
was supported by the anti-Quaker party, was intended to drag
them from their farms to work on the fortificatiotts of the
province.

In addition to the Germans, there was a large number

of Scotch-Irish who came to Pennsylvania. They were
so called because thev were descendants of Scots who had
taken up their residence in the north of Ireland. They were
bold, enterprising, and hardy, and favored a frontier life in
preference to settling in the more thicklv populated portions
of the pn)\ iiice. They disliked the Pope as heartily as they
venerated Calvin and Knox. They had left Ulster in Ire-
land because of religious bigotry, cummercial jealousy, and

cyppresskm hf the landlordfl. The Scotch had heen per-
giiaded to take up at veiy low leiicals the bmb IbHdted
hf the Irish. By industry and fhigsdity&gt; they pfospered
where the Irish had eked out but a bare subsistence. This
prosperity aroused the avaricioutness of the landlords, who,
upon the expiration of the leases, demanded higher rents.
The Scotch refused to submit to this species of extortion,
while the Roman Catholics, eager to regain their old lands
upon almost any conditions, readily agreed to pay the higher
rentals. The Irish bid higher for the lands than did the
Scotch, and the latter were disp&gt;ossessed. Many of the first
Scotch-Irish emigrants settled in Bucks, Chester, and York
Counties, and later in the Kittatinnv valley.

The Quaker?; had not lueti called upi)n for twenty-five
years to contribute toward the expenses of an actual war
with a foreign nation. During that period, the province
had increased in wealth, its commerce had developed un-
assailed by French privateers, and it had not been burdened
with taxes to support the wars of ihe mother country. In
October, 17 ^9, however, war was declared between Eng-
land and Spain, anJ privateers were soon scouring the seas.
This was the "War of Jenkins's Kar," which was followed
shortly by the great War of the Austrian Succession.
Governor Thomas at once made a request for aid from the
Assemblf. The reply was mumed that: »The QuakeiB
do not (as the world is now ciicumstanced) condemn the
use of arms in others, yet are principled against it them-
selves." They admitted, however, that those who thought
tt right to fight had ^uk equal right to liberty of conscience
with others." In recognition of this fiict, they would not
oppoae any movement on his part to organise a voluntary
militia outside of the laws and without a consultation with
the Assembly. In his attempt to force the Assembly to
give up what he considered their foolish scruples, the gov*
ernor was completely defeated. Finally, on the advice of the
Duke of Newcastle, he permitted an officer of the regular
army to recruit volunteers* Seven hundred men were thus



MIODLE STAtMS AHD MJRYLAifD



raised, although the quoti from Penntylvania was ooljr four
hundred. As many of these volunteers were redemption ers,

a new cause for complaint was lodged against the governor.
He wns offered ^3,000 by the Assembly if he would prevent
the enlistment of these servant*;, who still had considerable
time to serve. The governor declined the oticr and raided
the ntcessarv funds on the credit of the British o;over?Ttiu'iiL
The Assembly appro[)riated at least j^2,500 to indemnity the
masters who had lost ihcu servants.

iiy his imjwlitic manner of cicaluig with the Ai.^enibl) ,
the governor soon developed an anti-governor party. The
clash came at the election in the autumn of 1 742. There
waf contidenble riodng at the polls, and over fikf of the
diftuiben of the peace wete locked up in the jaiL The
Quaken weft entirely successful in the election, and all
the old membeit of the Assembly were letumed. The
governor acknowledged himself completely defeated, and
agreed to the bills the Assembly demanded. He was re-
warded by having all his back pay granted him. The war
with France had been renewed in the meantime, and the
governor showed his change of heart by enlisting men only
from the combatant portion of the people and by making
no requisition upon the Assenibly for money.

In this effort to recruit soldiers, Thomas was ably assisted
by Benjamin Franklin. He wrote pamphlets on the subject
and called a meeting ot ilu- p&lt;'ople, at which he urged them
to form an association for defence. As a result of his
eftorts, ten thousand volunteers were enrolled, and armed
and equipped at their own expense. Thev were called

lin had appeared before the public, but it was the Erst time
he had contributed to the province a real service. Bom
in Boston, January 17, 1706, he was apprenticed to his
brother James, who was a printer. During his apprentice*
ship he contributed to his brother's paper several anonymous
articles that were warmly commended. Having quarrelled

with his brother, at seventeen years of age he came to Phila-
delphia, where he continued in the printing trade. Here
he became acquainted with Governor Keith, who sent him
back to Boston, to his father, with strong recommendations
that he be made a master printer. His father paid no atten-
tion to this advice. Next, at the instance of Keith, he
went to London, expecting the governor to furnish him
with letters of credit and introduction that would enable
him to return a master printer. After reaching London,
he discovered that Keith had thoroughly deceived him. He
had but fifteen pistoles in his pockets, but set out to look
for work. Finally, be was employed at a printing house in
Bartholomew Close, where he stayed a year, during which
time he earned good wages and ^squandered them on idle
companions, lewd women, treats, and shows.*'

In 1726 he returned to Pennsylvania, and with the assist-
ance of some friends he established himself in business.
Three years later he came before the public for the second
time. Franklin had made his first appearance in political
life in Pennsylvania during the paper-money controvert
of the administration of Governor Gordon. He wrote a
pamphlet on The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency,
Franklin was at that time only twenty-three years old, had
been in the province onlv six year?;, rind was still 2. foreman in
the printing shop of Samuel Keimer. He was the recipient
of unstinted praise for the abilitv displayed in this pamphlet.
It was considered a "remarkable production, in advance of
his time, and an enlightenment of the Province." As a
matter of fact, it was a vcrv inferior production. It was
full of the most mischievous tallacies and was overrun with
the rankest financial heresies. He tried to show what a
great stimulant to trade and prosperity is an abundance of
money. The land bank scheme was as attractive to him as
had been John Law's Mississippi Company commercial stock
to the French public prior to the bursting of the bubble in
1 720 — just nine years before. Furthermore, he spoke of the
paper currency *^ as coined land,'* and maintained that anyone

MiDDLB STATJBS AND MJRTUND



who possessed hnd shottld have the privilco;c of coininp: it into
the new currency. Franklin argued, likewise, that the land
pledged as security should be "coined'* up to its full value.
He held that there was no dajigcr m this radical action, be-
cause land in Pennsylvania was steadily increasing in value.
Also that the issuance of the bills on the pledged lands, by
stimulating trade and industry, in turn augmented the value
of those lands. It was a species of financial reasoning in a
circle tint wat well wortliy of the times, but not of die man.
He showed a woeful lack of insight into human nature
arguing that no man would be so foolish as to borrow more
of the paper money than his land was worth and thereby
impair the value of the very money he was borrowmg*

Franklin did not go to the extreme of advocating an un-
limited issue of paper money, but he did believe it should be
issued in very larg^ amounts and that it should be kept equal
at least to the advancing value of land. This he considered
the very acme of conservatism and far within the limits of
safety. Franklin always hrlieved the pamphlet exerted a
^rcat mfiuencc upon the people at that time and had much
weight in the hnai decision of the matter, it may have
had some influence upon those of the rank and file of the
colonists who cherished the fond delusion that something
could he created out of nothing and that they themselves
were to become the happy recipients of the wealth thus
created. The pamphlet had probably no influence what-
ever, either upon the members of the Assembly or upon the
influential people in private life. By these classes it was
either ignored entirely or its faults excused *^for the sake
of a certain power of statement it displayed, which gave
promise of better things." In a part of his autobiography,
written in 1771, Franklin himself, writing of paper money,
admitted that he had arrived at the opinion that there are
limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful."

In 1730 Franklin married Miss Deborah Read, with
whom he had become acquainted before his departure for
England. The year before, he had become the editor and

the paper he sougjht to make vehicles of useful infonnatioii
lor the people. They inculcated especially the virtues of
bvffJdtj and industry. Whatever may have been the finan-
cial heresies of his youth, Franklin was always on the side
of eveiy enterprise which in his judgment would make for
the public good. Both to his personal efibrts and to his
pen is due the credit of the foundation of the Philadelphia
Library in 1731. His wisdom, foresight, and public spirit
gained an almost immediate recognition. ^ By his talcmts,
prudence, and integrity, he continued to rise in the estima-
tion of the community in which he lived, until he was
dccTiud worthy of the highest honors which the country
could bestow."

In 1736 Franklin bccaiue clerk of the Assembly, which
office he accepted probably from the "double motive of
serving the public and also himself." By accepting; the
political oiiicc he thoii(j;ht some of the public printing n^ight
fail to his lot.- He was not disappoiiiicd in his hopes. He
was chosen for the same position the following year, though
at first oppoaed by a member of the Assembly, who put
forward a candidate *«wliose merits were compared with
Fianklin's failing^'* FianUin gained the support of this
member by borrowing and dvfy retumtng a curious book.
The member through this means became better acquainted
with Fianklin, and later became his firiend. Franklin was
made postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, and deputy post-
master-geneial for the British Colonies in 1753. In 1757
he was sent to £ngtand as agent of the Assembly to ploid
the cause of the people in opposition to the claim of ex-
emption from taxation on the part of the proprietaries.
He was entirely successful in his arguments before the
Privv Council, which decided that the estates of the pro-
prietaries should bear their due proportion of the public

burdens. He teceived tfae thanks of the Assembler on his
mum for his able and faithful presentation of its cause.
In 1 752 he made the experiment with the kite by which he
brilliantly proved the identity of lig|itning and electricity.
The accountt of his early experiments read before the
Roya] Society attracted but little attention. " The paper/'
I says Franklin in his autobiography, ^ which I wrote for

Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with elec-
tricity, • • • was laughed at by the connoisseurs."
These papers soon attracted the attention of the French,
' hou'cvcr, and later were again brought before the notice of

the Royal Society. "They soon made me," says Krauklm,
"more than amends for the sHght with which they had
before treated me.'* He was made a member of the soci-
ety without ain applicatiuii being made on his behalf and
without lIic payment of the customary dues on admission,
amounting in all to twenty-five guineas. They also hon-
ored him with the Copley gold medal (1753)9 and presented
him with a set of the Tramactimtt without charge. The
Univenities of Edinburgh and Oxford conferred upon him
the degree of Doctor of Laws, in 1762, before his return
to America. A similar honor had been conferred upon
^ him by the Scottish University of St, Andrews in the spring

, experiments. Sir Humphry Davy says: •*A singular felicity

of induction guided all his researches, and by very small
means he established very grand truths : the style and man-
ner of his publication are almost as worthy of admiration as
the doctrines it contains. . . . He has written equally
for the umnitiated and for the philosopher."

In 1749, Franklin wrote a pamphlet entitled Proposals
Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania, This
led to the formation of an association by some prominent
Citizens of Philadelphia for the purpose of establishing an
institution of learning higher in standard than any in the
city at that time. They selected the iinancially embarrassed
Charitable School which had been founded in 1740, and

money for the college. In 1 7 79, the legishttiire confiscated
all the rights and properties of the college and bestowed
them on a newly chartered institution called the " University
of the State of Pennsylvania." This was the first univer-
sity in the United States. Ten wars later, the art of con-
fiscation was rescinded anci the rights and properties were
restored to the original irisdtution. In 1791, the old college
and the new university were amalgamated by an act of the
legislature under the name "l*he University of Pennsyl-
vania/' 1 he medical school, the oldci&gt;t in America, was
founded in 1765 and the law department in 1790.

Before continuing the thread of our nanativc, it would
be well to mention at this point some events of interest in
the early Ustoiy of printing and publishing in Pennsylvania.
William Bndfbid set up the ftm printing press in Philadel-
phta in 1685* An almanac by Daniel Leeds^ a student of
agricukm», was one of the earliest books published. Most
of the books and pamphlets published were of a religious char-
acter. The first exception to this rule was a hook of (ravels
by Jonathan Dickinson, entitled Go^rs Protecting Provultnet,
Certain it is that the title of this book of itself does not
prove the exception . The typography b descri bed as wretch-
edly executed and disfigured by constant blunders. The
Bradfords supplied Philadelphia with printers for over one
hundred years. They printed the nrst newspapers in both
New York and Philadelphia. Andrew Bradford, son of
William Bradford, printed at Philadelphia, December 22,
1 719, the Amcru iin IVeekly ii/mttry, which was the first
newspaper published m the province. The same printer,
as we have seen, removed to New York and brought out

the Ntiv y'ork Gazette, tlie hrst newspaper printed in that
city, in October, 1725. Franklin planned the Pennsylvania
Gazette^ and in 1 729 became its proprietor. He made the first
copperplate printing press used in America. The printers
usually combined their business with bookbinding and book
selling, and in some instances even dealt in groceries and
fancy goods. Some, likewise, served the public as importers
of books on law, medicine, and history, those books being
most in demand at that time. In 1782, Robert Aitken
printed at his shop in Philadelphia the first Bible in English
published in America. Among other printers was Christo-
pher Saur, the publisher of Der Hoch-Deutsch Pimyhfauuche
Geschicht-Schrelbt-r, who printed the Bible in German.

In 1 749 the money question was again brought promi&gt;
ncntiy before the people. The circulation of the bills of
credit had been diminished greatly by reason of the payment
of the former loans. For this reason the Assembly desired
to issue additional paper monev at a lower rate of interest
and in larger amounts to iiiclividuals. The plan was to issue
;^8o,ooo, payable in sixteen years by annual instalments.
Whatever amounts were repaid were to be reissued for the
remainder of the period. The maximum amount that could
be lent to individuals was allowed to remain the same as
in the last issue, and the interest was placed at five per
cent. Governor Thomas strongly objected to the bill,
insisting that it was unfiur to the proprietaries. After a
heated discussion of the subject, a compromise was finally
arranged by which the proprietaries agreed to accept a fixed
sum to cover fluctuations in the value of the currency.
These difficulties being overcome, the bill became a hw,
and the sum of ;^8o,000 was kept in circulation.

As a result of the careful investigation into the operation
of the paper-money systems in the different colonies, Parlia-
ment passed a bill in 1751 prohibiting the northern colonies
from issuing or reemitting bills of credit except for extraor-
dinary emergencies. Through the efforts of its agents and
of the proprietaries, Pennsylvania was not included within

GROWTH or A m^AKEti COMMONWEAVTH 41;



the scope of this bill. The following year, the Assembly
wished to issue £\o^ooo more of the currency, but later"
reduced it one-half owing to the opposition of the governor.
That opposition not being withdrawn, a committee to con-
sider and report on the currency was appointed. As chair-
man of this committee, Franklin showed the benefit of the
paper money by pointing to the great internal improvements,
the great increase in manufactures and in population. In
1 730 the number of vessels clearing the ports of the province
was one hundred and seventy-one, in 1734 the number had
increased to two hundred and twelve, while from 1 749 to
1752 it had averaged over four hundred annually. The
population had ncaiU' doabk-J m twenty years. Commerce
had extended westward, until it included remote Indian
tribes. Agriculture was flourishing, and the loan office
made the purchase of land easy. *^Yct, great as these
benefits were,'^ reported the committee, ^^they might have
been much greater had this easy method for the purchase
and improvement of lands kept pace, as it ought to have
done, with the growing numbers of die people. Even at
this time, though application had been greatly discouraged
through failure of success, there were not less than one
thousand on the list, waiting their turn to be supplied."

Governor Thomas resigned in the summer of 1 746, and
his place was assumed temporarily by Anthony Palmer,
president of the Council. Thomas's departure was greatly
regretted. He had at first opposed both proprietary and As-
sembly and had regarded particularly the king's interests;
but he soon profited by experience and seldom clashed with
the popular leo;islat!vc body. Palmer was shortly compelled
to call the attention of the Assembly to the bold privateer-
ing attempts of the French and the Spaniards. They did
not hesitate to enter the bav and plunder the mhabiuiits
along the shores. In fact, a Spanish pnvatcci commanded
by Don Vincent Lopez sailed up the river, under the Eng-
lish flag, almost as hx as New Oistle and committed depre-
dations upon small shipping. But the Assembly would not

move in the matter. The treacherous channel of the Dela-
ware and the dangers incident to its navigation, the mem-
bers thought, would protect the city and province from
serious injury by the privateers.

The reason for this inactivity by the Assembly was the
latent Quaker opposition to hostilities, either offensive or
defensive. Logan and some other prominent Qualcers be-
lieved in defensive war and always lent their aid to the
governor. They favored the erection of a battery below
the city. Some of them were rich and exercised consider-
able political power. The influence of the Scotch-Irish
Presbyterians was frit likewise. They were becoming more
numerous and important, and their arguments in favor of
defence no doubt had some credit with the young Qiiakcrs.
The little subterfuges resorted to in makinjr appropria-
tions illustrate this silent approbation of defence by many
(fakers. Franklin cites two cases that very well illus-
trate this state uf uund. The Quaker members of a iire
company allowed money to be appropriated for purposes of
defence by hot appearing at the meeting when the money
was voted. Franklin estimated that nineteen out of every
twenty Quakers favored the war. When the Assembly was
asked to contribute to the expedition against Louisburg,
£4.&lt;fiOO was voted *^to be expended,*' they said, «^ in the
purchase of bread, beef, pork, flour, wheat, or other grain."
Franklin held that the words ^ other grain "were inserted by
the Assembly for the specific purpose of allowing the gov-
ernor to purchase gunpowder. When urged to demand a
better bill, the governor replied he knew what the Assembly
meant. The gunpowder was purchased and no objection was
urged. The first proprietary himself appointed a professional
soldier governor of the colony and gave him authority as a
captain-general to levy war. Another time, he is said to
have requested the king to fuuiish nicn-of-war to protect
Pennsylvania from the French. It was a common prac-
tice for Quaker merchants to employ convoys for the pro-
tection of their ships. In fact, it may be said that the

scruples of the Quaken a^unst war were more fancied
than real.

James Hamilton, the son of Andrew Hamilton the eminent
lawyer, was appointed lieutenant-governor in November,
1 748. He did not take up the duties of his administration
under the most auspicious circumstances. The war just
closed, the War of the Austrian Succession, had lasted nine
years and had been brought to a close by the Peace of Aix-
la-Chapelle in 1748. Pennsylvania had contributed little in
money and soldiers toward the war, and had suffered but little
Joss from the depredations of the enemies. The northern
colonies had borne the brunt of the war, while Pennsylvania
was left in peace to cultivate its soil and to develop its com-
merce. But Pennsylvania, likewise, was to experience the
hardships of warfare. The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had
satisfied neither party ,^ and it was in reality nothing more
than a truce. In America, in fact, it did not even amount
to a cessation of hostilities. All felt that the great struggle
was postponed hut a few years at most. All saw that the
renewal of hostilities was inevitable.

Eagjer to extend their territories, and to connect their
northern possessions with Louisiana, the French had pro-
jected a line of forts and military posts along the Missis-
sippi and the Ohio. The latter river was explored, and the
lands upon both sides were occupied. Leaden plates with
inscriptions declaratory of their claims to the river and the
lands adjacent thereto were buried in many places. They
established themselves at Presquc' lie, and, proceeding south-
ward, they erected a fort at Au Baeuf, and another at the
mouth of French Creek, knou n as Fort Machault. By
the end of 1753 they had completed a chain of forts hum
Montreal lo i' reach Creek. Major Washington was sent
in December, 1753, to warn the trespassers to retire. Gov-
ernor Hamilton appealed to the Pennsylvania Assembly
for assistance to help the Virginia authorities to expel the
French. Hamilton tried to prove that the enemy was really
on Pennsylvania 8oil« but the Assembly stoutly maintained

that Viipnia soil only had been as ytt invaded and that the
Virginians should be left to attend to their own afFain.
Washington was delcated at Fort Necessity, and Hamilton
ag^ made a ihiitless appeal for an appropriation. This time
he would have secured it had he been tactful. In fact, the
Assembly voted an appropriation ; b\jt upon the governor's
insisting on his power to amend, the hill was withdrawn
entirely. These events were leading rapidly to that great

CHAPTER XVII



DSrSLOPMBNT OP MJRTXAND, 1714^1754

The first roynl governor, Sir Lionel Copley, arrived in
Maryland in 1692 and the a;overnment was handed over
to him by the colonial Convention. His Council was ap-
pcjinted largely from among the " Associators," m whose
hands was the government. His first Assembly was pre-
sided over by Keiultn CheseliU n as speaker. Mention has
been made oi tlic tact that the Assembly's first move was
the recognition of the tide of William and Mary, to whom
an address was presented dianking them for delivennce
from tTianntad Popish government under which they
had long groaned/' This same Assembly made the Protes-
tant Episcopal Chtireh the established Church of the prov-
ince. The ten counties were divided into parishes, and
an annual poll tax of for^ pounds of tobacco was im-
posed for Church purposes. In 1702 a toleration clause
was added to the act exempting Protestant Dissenters and
Quakers from penalties and disabilities. They were given
permission to have separate meeting houses, provided they
had paid the poll tax to which reference has been made.
This exemption did not extend to Roman Catholics, who,
on the contrary, were treated more severely. The oath
of " abhorrence " was required in addition to the oath of
allegiance, and no Roman Catholic attorney was given per-
mission to engage in his profession. This severe action
against the Roman Catholics was due largely to the state

of intemational politics. Mailborough had been dismissed,
and Louis XIV* was making fonnidable preparations to com*
pel the reinstatement of James. The French and Indians
were threatening Albany, and it was nimcHcd that parties of
them were even hovering about the head of Chesapeake Bay«
Governor Copley died in 1693, and, after a **brief and
violent interval" of Sir Edmund Andros, was succeeded by
Francis Nicholson, late Governor of Virginia. The capital
of the province was changed from St. A4ary's to Annapolis,
in spite of the remonstrances of the inhabitants of the former
place. This act of the governor, in connection with other
unpopular acts, caused a certain amount of disaffection that
found a ready response in John Coode. This is the same
Coode who played an important part in the fendali revolt
of 1681. He was arrested, tried, and acquitted; neverthe-
less, even during his trial, he conttiiucti to sit. as a delegate.
He iicxt made his appearance at the head of the forces that
captured St. Mary's, overthrew the proprietary government,
and prodaimed William and Mary King and Queen of
England, In 1696 he had been elected to the Lower
House, but Governor Nicholson refused to qualify him on
account of his clerical orders, holding that once a priest
always a priest and that a repudiation of the priestly robes
did not of itself change the circumstances. Smarting under
this defeat, Coode got together some men of the baser
element and threatened that having pulled down one gov-
ernment he could pull down another. He failed utterly in
his efforts to stir up disaffection, and was ultimately indicted
by the irrnnd jtirv. However, he escaped to Virginia, where
he lived uiuicr the protection of Governor Andros until
in 1 701, after having presented an abject petition, he was
pardoned. He regained much of his old popularity, and in
1 708 he sat in the Assembly as a tlelcgatc. Browne [Alary'
landy 188) presents him to us in any other than a favorable
light. He says: ^^In throwing off the clerical habit Coode
seems to have renounced religion, morality, and even com-
mon decency} he was a blatant. blasphemer, railing openly

at Christianity and the Bible; he had raised a Hmd to build
a church, and appropriated a great part of it ; and on one
occaaion he was so drunk and disorderly during divine service
that Qovernor Nicholson caned him with his own hand/'

On January 2, i698&gt; Nicholson was transferred to the
government of Virginia, and his executive mantle fell upon
Nathaniel Blakiston. In 1703 the latter resigned, and the
office passed to John Seymour. Maryland was affected
very little by the carlv colonial wars, not being situated in
close proximity to the borders. During King William's
W^ar the province had sent a gift of £joo to thr (rovernor
of New York for ilcfc nce against ihc 1' rcnch ami Indians,
hut was unable to snul any troops. A quota ol men and
supplies was demanded bv the king in 1694.

Queen Anne's War brokt; out in i 702, but though French
ships of war cruised in Chesapeake Bay almost as far norih
as Annapolis^ Marv land did not suffer as a result of it. The
coast was mtcstcd by pirates, who were aided and protccicd,
some say, by the Pcnnsylvanians. Of course, the name of
Captain Kidd appears foremost in the list of pirates. Several
of them wm captured in Maiyland and were sent over to
England for trial, until courts of admiral^ were establidied
in the province. In 1 704 the people of the colonf were
brought into close touch with the war through the exploits
of Richard J&lt;^sonf in command of a brigantine. He was
captured off Martinique by a French privateer. Before
reaching the French pon for which the captor headed, he,
with another Englishman, took possession of the privateer
through strategy, threw the captain overboard, and then
leached Maryland in safety, where they had their prize
condemned and sold.

A war with France always seemed to be considered by
the authorities a just cause for greater severity in the treat-
ment of the Roman Catholics. Queen Anne*s War was no
exception tf&gt; the rule, for the alarm was spread that the
people of that faith in the province were planning to assist
the French. 1 he priesu were not permitted to say Mass or

exercise any priestly function, on penalty of fine and impris-
onment. Furthermore, should any Roman Catholic teach
or even board young persons, he was to be transported to
England for trial. The incoming of Irish Romanists was
discouraged by the imposition of a poll tax of twenty shil-
lings. It is instructive to note that the same duty was laid
on negroes, who were now being imported in large numbers
direct from Africa, whereas formerly they had been imported
for the most part hom the West Indies. It was estimated
that there were eight thousand negroes in the province in
1712, out of a population of forty-six thousand.

Edward Lloyd, president of the Council, acted as gov-
ernor during the interim between Governor Seymour's death
in 1 709 and the appointment of John Hart. The new gov-
ernor was appoint^ through the influence of Benedict
Leonard Calvert* The latter having abjured the Roman
Catholic faith had been admitted into the Church of Eng-
land. He was the son and heir of Charles, third Loid
Baltimore and second proprietary, and, needless to say, his
abjuration of the faith of his family was a great blow to the
elder Calvert. The yearly allowance of ^^450 was with-
drawn, and the son was compelled to appeal to Queen Anne
for assistance. He was granted a pension of ;^300 by the
queen during the lifetime of his father, and by a settlement
with Governor Hart he received ^^500 m additi(jn. Upon
his accession in 17 14, George I. renewed all these favors.
On February 20, 1715, Charles, Lord Baltimore, died and
was succeeded in his titles and estates b\' his son. The latter,
however, likewise died on the 5th of the following April, and
was succeeded bv his minor son Charles, who became fifth
Lord Baltimore and fourth proprietary. Because he was a
Protestant, the province was restored to the young proprie^
taiy,^ to g^ve encouragement to the educating of the numer-
ous issue of so noble a family in the Protestant religion."

Almost the last and one of the best contributions of the
royal government to the development of the province was
the thorough revision of the kiws. These had &amp;Uen into

Gonsiderable confusion by reason of many illogical change
and the Assembly took up the revision of the whole code in
1715. The work was done very satisfactorily, and the code
adopted served the province during the rest of the colonial
period and furnished the fundamental principles of the law
of the State of Maryland. In T722 a dispute was precipi-
tated which ended ultimately in dehning the exact relationship
between the Enp^lish common and statute law and the pro-
vincial laws and practices. The Upper House and the
proprietiiry contended that, in their application to provincial
jurisprutlcnce, the English statutes should be restricted to
those most suitable to the province and those that infringed
least upon the chartered nghts of the proprietary. The
Lower House, on the contrary, demanded the introduction
of all the statutes or the submission of the question of
selection to the courts. The contest lasted for years and
was finally decided in fovor of the Lower House. The
law of the province was to be made up of its own acts and
usages, but when they were silent the laws and statutes of
England were to be applied. The benefits of the English
law were to be secured without the abandonment of the
right to self-government. — (Browne, Maryland^ 204-207.)

Charles Calvert, uncle of the proprietary, succeeded Gov-
ernor Hart, who had been removed in 1720. At the dcnth
of the former in 1726, Benedict Leonard Calvert, brother of
Lord Baltimore, was appointed governor. The latter re-
signed in 1 731 on account ot ill health and was succeeded by
Samuel Ogle. Very few events of importance characterize
this period of the history of Maryland. 1 he colonists lived
(|uietly at their country seats and directed the cultivation
of their lands.

Maiyhmd was thoroughly Southern in the chancter of
its settlements. Municipalities did not thrive on its soil as
they did in New £ng|bmd and to a lesser extent in New
York and Pennsylvania. The two colonies upon the tribu-
taries of Chesapeake Bay were settled by an entirely difierent
type of people from that which settled the New England



426 . MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



ccJoniet. The envinmment, ftirthrnnore, was entireljr dif-
ferent. The early settlers of Maryland and Virginia were
cavaliers, or country gentlemen. They settled in a most
delightful climate, where the soil was rich and where both
land and water combined to furnish them a livelihood upon
the easiest terms imaginable. The numerous long, broad,
and deep rivers, flowing lazily and quietly toward the great
Chesapeske, furnished every planter a natural highway at
his very door. This environment, combined with the colo-
nists' natural love for the independence of a country life, led
the early settlers of Vir^nla and Maryland to take up their
plantations in favorable localities along the banks of the
navigable rivers. The swiftly moving streams of New
Kngland favored the development of manufacturing, which
necessitated town life. The Southern rivers favored the
developnient of agriculture of the large plantation type,
which in turn necessitated group isolation. In New Eng-
land, therefore, we find the town the important unit of local
governnicnt, while in rvlarylaiid and Virginia it is the county.
As we have a blending of the two extremes of character and
environment in the Middle colonies, so we find a mixture
of the two types of local government. In New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Debware, both the town and the
county are found to have importance.

Queen Anne tried to develop artificially what character
and environment had failed to devebp. She expressed a
wish that towns should be founded in Maryland, and the
Assembly reluctantly erected them ^'by batches." In 1706,
forty-two had thus been created, but hardly one passed
beyond the surveying stage of stakes and stones. Lots were
offered for sale, rights of entry and clearance were given the
ports, and everything, in fact, was done officially to make
the places more than paper towns. Onlv one minor detail
of successful town making was always lacking, namely, the
inhabitants.

only real towns. Then came Joppa^ upon Gunpowder River,
which for fifty years or mofe pfotpeved, while St. Marjr's
gradually declined. But JoppA was detdned to fall before a
greater rival; for, as Browne poetically puts it, Baltimore
came and "drew off her trade, and she gradually dwindled,
peaked, and pined away to ^ solitary house and a grass-
grown graveyard, wherein slumber the mortal remains of her
ancient citizens.**

Xhe increase in trade enjoyed by the planters along the
banks of the Patapsco suggested the pressing need of a
convenient port in that locality. The first steps for the
••erection" of a town on the Patapsco, to be called liaki-
more Town," were taken in 1729, when the Assembly was
petitioned for an enabling act. The act was passed, and
sixty acres bonfering on the northwest biandi of the river
were purchased for forty shillings an acre from Charles and
Daniel OurolL In January of the following year the site
was cut up into half&lt;acre lots, and streets were laid out.
The harbor was spacious and secure and had a depth of at
least twenty feet. The water-Aont lots were purchased
almost immediately, and the town started out upon its career
much more auspiciously than its two predecessors in name
of the century before. Of the shadowy and almost mytln
ical Bakimores of 1683 and 1693, there was never enough
of material existence to afford a moment's pleasure to the
most hopelessly confirmed sfiidcnt df antiquarian procliyi-
tics. A Baltimore was laid out on iiush Ri\rr, Baltimore
County, in 1683, and another in Dorchester Coiint\ a Jc-
cade later. Certain it is that they died, if they can be said
ever to have lived, "unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

The Baltimore of 1729 was fortunatrK' located in many
respects, the sue being at the head ot tidewater and naviga-
tion on Patapsco River, about fourteen miles from Chesa-
peake Bay and nearly two hundred miles up from the ocean.

mills and manu&amp;ctories. In substance, its mild climate, its
varied suils, its central location, its excellent harbor, fur-
nished it with all the natural qualifications for a great citj.
Yet its growth at first was very slow, not having been greater
than twenty dwellings and one hundred inhabitants during
the first twenty years. In 1752 it contained twenty-five
houses and two hundred persons, while in 1765 the numher
had increased to fifty houses. After thi«s the growth was
much more rapid, and in 1 7 75 the population had risen
to five thuusand nine hundred and thirty-four, and there
were five hundred and sixty-tuur houses, i'he town was
incorporated as a city in 1 797.

Practically the only serious disturbance that arose to
aiiaoy the colony during the period under consideration was
due to the territorial encroachments of Pennsylvania. The
history of Maryland could easily be written from the point of
view of the establishment of her boundaries. The urgency
of the Virginia*Maryland border difficulties was one of the
immediate causes of the assembling of those conventions
and congresses that led finally to the formation of a more
perfect union in 1 789. In turn, the adoption of the Federal
Constitution made possible a peaceable settlement of the
boundary disputes. The unsettled condition of the territorial
limits of Maryland was an inheritance which naturally came
from the vagueness of colonial grants and charters. In some
instances these overlapped, and in other cases an intervening
neutral space was left thnt afforded ground for disputes. In
most cases, however, the disputes arose from a misunder-
standing with reference to the exact location of some natural
obiect, — a tree, a stone, a hill, a tributary, or a cape. The
boundary question vexed the wisdom and temper of many
governors, both of Maryland and Pennsylvania.

The order of the Privy Council dated 1685 had deter-
mined iMaryland's eastern boundary by dividing Delaware
between Lord Baltimore and William Penn. The northern
boundary had been definitely fixed in the grants of the two
proprietaries. The southern boundaiy of Penn's grant was



bigiiized by Google



DEySLOPMBNr OP MARYLAND



the fortieth paiallel, while the nonheni boundary of Balti-
more's grant was the same parallel. For a long time, how-
ever, Penn had refused to cooperate with Baltimore in
definitely determining that parallel. He realized fully, no
doubt, that it was decidedly to his advantage to keep the
matter unsettled. And so it proved; for after the fortieth
parallel \\ as surv eyed, both Chester and Philadelphia were
found to be located well south of it. They were thus within
the limits of Maryland, as prescribed by the original charter
grants of both Lord Baltimore and William Penn.

William Penn was one of the shrewdest proprietors that
ever held a grant for a rood of land on this continent. He
had Quaker forbearance and British pugnacity, and with
this ha{}p7 combuiation of virtues he very seldom entered
upon a territorial dispute without coming out the victor.
And, one might add, dieie was not a square foot of territoiy
upon which he had the ghost of a squatter's claim but that
he backed that claim with all the cunning, force, and influ*
ence at his command. When cunning would serve his pur-
pose better than anything else, he used it as few others could.
When force was necessary, there was no one who could strike
harder and more effectually than he. These two qualities,
together with his influence with the English king, made him
a power to be feared. All three weapons he used in de-
fence of his bound ir\ pretensions. Had it not been for the
strength of Lord Baltimore's position, combined with some
excellent qualities of character possessed by that individual
himself, William Penn would undoubtedly have grabbed all
of Maryland that Virginia nuglit have graciously leit. Wil-
liam Penn found Lord Baltimore a " foeman worthy of his
sceel;" and if the former usually won his point, the victory
was diminished to such an extent that it was but little more
than a defeat. Furthermore, it was not a victory won in
every case because of the better diplomacy of Penn so
much as because of the unpopularity of the iaith repre-
sented by Lord Baltimore. For was not religious toleration
first exemplified in Maiyland?

In no event arc the c harac tcristics of Pcnn shown better
than in the estabhshment of the houndary between his pos-
sessions ni die peninsula and lhui»c Loid iiakimure. The
disputed territory in this case was what is now called Balti-
more Hundred, in the southeastern part of Delaware. The
name of the hundred is indicative of Lord Baltimore's claim.
The right to Baltimore Hundred was in dispute for nearly
a century and was not determined until 1775, when it was
settled in favor of Delaware. Land warrants issued prior
to this settlement claimed this district as being in Worcester
County, Maryland, In 1682 WiUiam Penn occupied this
disputed territory and claimed as its southern boundary Fen-
wick's Island, then called Cape Henlopen. The present
cape of that name was at that time called Cape Cornelius
and later Cape Inlopeiu Prior to 1682, Baltimore Hun-
dred was embraced in several patents issued by the Duke
of York.

Disputes soon arose between William Penn and Lord
Baltimore as to what cape was meant in the grants, and
these disputes were continued until the final official settle-
ment in 1775. The method Penn employed to gain pos-
session of a part of the disputed tcrritor\ will illustrate his
shrewdness. On March 4, i68j, he orcicretl a survey to
be made of a tract of ten thousand acres for a manor for
the Duke of York. The location suggested was ^a rich
ridge at the head of the Murderkill Creek, near Choptank
road," But instead of locating it anywhere near the place
indicated, it was surv^ed on what is now Fenwick's Isbnd.
This survey g^ve weight to the claim of Penn's successors
to this territory when the question came up for final adju-
dication. For over a half-century the territory continued in
dispute. Overt acts of aggression and resistance liequently
marked the progress of the quarrel, A petty boundary
warfare was carried on.

After the death of Penn in 1718, his sons, who had
jointly inherited the proprietorship, continued their father's
dilatory tactics. In 1732 they succeeded in securmg a

written agreement from Charles Calvert, Lord Baltimore,
liy w hich they obtained all that they had demanded. The
boundarv line was to run due north through the middle of
the Delaware peiiiiisulj. until it touched the circumference
of a circle having a radius of twelve miles from the town of
New Castle as its centre. From this point of intersection
the line Ifollowed the circumference of the circle north and
east untO a point in Delaware River was reached fifteen
miles sooth of Philadelplua. Thence the houndaiy was to
run due west to the extent that the two provinces were
conterminous.

Baltimore visited Maiyhuid in 1732 for the purpose of
examining personally the facts in the boundary controversy.
He appointed his cvMumissioners provided for by the agree-
ment to which reference has already been made. The
Pennsylvania commissioners failed upon two occasions to
meet the Maryland commissioners at New Ckstle. Joppa
was next proposed as the meeting place, but the sugges^
tion was not accepted. The condition of affairs now grew
too serious for the question under dispute to be permitted to
continue longer unsettled. On May 14, the Penn-

sylvania Council, sitting at Philadelphia, was informed that
Maryland had acted in a very unneighborly manner; that
some inhabitants of Pennsylvania who lived on the border
were constantly annoyed by Marylanders, some of them,
in fact, having brcn carried off and imprisoned. Further-
more, It was asseriLd that the Marylandcrs had laid claim to
some land by extending their border lurtiicr than ever had
been done before. In order to come to an understanding,
Messrs. Hamilton and Georges were appointed commis-
sioners to bring about some agreement between the proprie-
taries and I. ore! liLiIdniurc in retj^rud to "laying out lines,
limits, aiid buunJaries." After visiting Annapolis, they re-
turned and presented a report of their work. It was not
satisfactory, however, and the Pennsylvania governor directed
a letter to die justices of the counties of Chester, Lancas*
ter. New Castle&gt; Kent» and Sussex, reviewing the situation.



MIDDLE STATES AND MAkYlASD



They were advised of the necessity of protecting persons
along the border, and of preventing citizens of other prov-
inces from encroaching upon Pennsylvania territory. They
were to make frequent visits and tours along the border,
promising the inhabitants aid whenever it should be needed.

The disturbances, indeed, became quite serious. Some
fifty or sixty families of Palatines who had settled in Balti-
more County, Maryland, were promised exemption, it is
said, hum militia duty and the poll tax of forty shillings
if they would declare their allegiance to Pennsylvania and
refuse to pay the Mru yl^uiti tax assessments. Sheriff's' posses
representing both the proprietaries invaded the debatable ter-
ritory and made arrests. Armed bands prowled round the
county, beating men of the opposite side or carrying them
off to prison. The following incident, as related by Browne,
is typical of many others that occurred during this period of
bolder warfare: **Sherifl[s on both sides summoned posses
and made inroads into the debatable territory, arresting and
carrying off prisoners; houses were attacked by armed
bands, and men on both sides beaten or dragged off to
prison. Sheriff Buchanan, of Lancaster County, with a
party, enters the house of a Dutchman, one Loughman or
Lachmann, a Marylander, and beats him unmercifully. His
wife interposes, and the discourteous sheriff beats her, until
Lachmann consents to go with him as his prisoner. But
on the way they meet five Dutchmen, who, seeing the
plight of their countryman, set on the sheriff, rout his [)osse,
and carry him off into captivity." Mention might also be
made of Thomas Cresap, one of the most violent of the
Maryland partisans. His house was burst into by a party
of Pennsylvanians, who threatened to burn the house and
hang the owner. At another time, their threat to bum the
house was put into eflect, and the inmates were fired upon
aa they tried to escape. One man was killed, and Cresap,
who was among those wounded, was carried off a prisoner
to Philadelphia, where he was lodged in jaiL Strenuc^us
efforts were made by Governor Ogle, of Maiyland, to have

Cresap released. Failing in his efforts to accomplish this
end, he ordered the arrest of a dozen of the principal par-
ticipants in the riot* This was done successfully by a party

of Marylanders. Then followed a period of border warfare
interspersed with proclamations, peaceful and warlike, on
the part of the governors of the two provinces. The land
was constantly harried by sheriffs' posses from both prov-
inces and by unauthorized bands led by adventurous leaders
who took advantage of the riotous times to ply successfully
their border brigandage.

The condition of affairs grew so alarming that appeal
was finally made to the king by the governor and Assembly
of Maiyland, requesting assistance in bringing an end (o
the border warfare. The crown thereupon issued an order
in Council commanding an observance of the peace on the
part of both contesting parties. The proprietaries were like-
wise enjoined not to make any new grants in the disputed
territory until the whole boundary question could be ad-
justed. Furthermore, for the sake of temporary peace, the
governors of both Maryland and Pennsylvania agreed to
the establishment of a provisional boundary line. This line
was to be accepted by the inhabitants actually in possession
of the disputed territory as valid in all their relations. In
the words of the compromise, then, it was agreed " that the
respective Proprietaries should hold and exercise jurisdic-
tion over the lands occupied by themselves and tenants at
the date of the agreement, though such lands were beyond
the limits thereimifter prescribed, until the final settlement
of the boundary lines, and that the tenants of the one
should not interfere with the other." This arrangement
was to last tmtil a final adjustment of the boundary could
be made by the English Court of Chancery.

Finally, the opposing parties came together and appointed
commissioners to settle the boundary dispute. In 1739
Colonel Levin Gale and Samuel Chamberlain were ap-
pointed commissioners to represent Maryland, and Richard
Fetets and Lawrence Growden to represent Pennsylvania.



MIDDLE STATES JND MARriAHD



The entire boundary line between Main land and the Lower
Counties (/. e.^ Delaware) was to be settled. By the terms
of agreement of 1732, the transpeninsular line was to begin
at Cape Hcnlopen. This, of course, precipitated the vexed
question as to the exact location of this cape — whether it
was where Cape Henlopen is now situated or on Fenwick's
Island. A difference in the method of spelling the name
of the cape gave rise to this controversy. By the early
Swedish settlers the cape now known as Henlopen was
called "Inlopen," and the «^ exterior or folse cape" at Fen-
wick's Island Henlopen " or *^ Hinlopen." The Swedish
aspirate letter*^ H " prefixed to the word *^ Inlopen" changed
it from ^interior" to ^exterior" cape. The matter in dis-
pute was referred to the Lord Chancellor of England, who
decided that the terms of agreement should be interpreted as
fixing the beginning of the line at the exterior cape, or Fen-
wicJc's Island. In this manner the long-standing boundary
dispute was definitely settled.

The line was not surveyed, however, without much diffi-
culty, not to speak of danger and privation. These difficul-
ties are recorded by one John Watson in a most interesting
manner. He was one of the surveyors appointed by the
Pennsj lvaiiia commissioners to assist in the survey of 1750.
He kept a catcful diaiy, and it is from this diary that we get
some interestmg information with regard to the details of
the survey. In the first place, he tells of the ridiculous
controversy that arose between the commissioners concern-
ing the manner in which the twelve miles' radius establishing
the northern boundary of what is now Delaware should
be measured. The Maryhmd representatives held that it
should be measured upon the surface of the earth, while
those from Pennsylvania held just as stoutly that it should
be made by " horizontal measurement,'' and not by follow-
ing the inequalities of the earth's surface. The former
method would have been, of course, to the advantage of
Maryland, and the latter to the advantage of Pennsylvania.
This was the occasion of the scholastic dispute. The

question was referred to the courts, and the Pennsylvania
point of view was sustained.

What concerns us more particularly in this place is
Watson's account of the difficulties and inconveniences the

surveyors experienced in projecting the boundary line from
Fenwiclc's Island to Chesapeake Bay. It seems that they
were frequently in imminent danger of drowning by the
tide overflowing " Phoenix Island " [Fenwick's Island] while

they were encamped upon it. This can be readily under-
stood when we reral! the fact that in 1 831 a great tidal
wave swept over the iDiire island, drowning all the cattle
as well as several persons who happened to be upon it at
tlie time.

After much wrangling as to details, the sun'cv was begun
and the line projected several miles. But un January 8,
1 750, the surveyors were compelled to discontinue work by
reason of the great accumulatk&gt;n of ice on the marshes and
lowlands. The next spring, on April 29, 1 75 1 9 the work
was resumed, and the line was advanced thirteen miles.
Then an unexpected obstacle was encountered. The men
assisting the surveyors struck for higher wages. The work
was delayed, but in the end the surveyors were compelled
to accede to the demands of the strikm, for it was impos-
sible to secure other assistance. The work was thereupon
continued without further delay, except that incident to the
swampy condition of the soil. On June 15, 1751, the line
was completed to Chesapeake Rav, a distance of sixty-nine
miles t^v^ hundred and ninety-eight perches from the starting
point on yenu-ick's Island.

The long strip of coast line, fortified by sand dunes and
backed by Assawoman Bay and broad stretches of marsh,
called Fenwick's Island is indeed an island. But this was
not the case in former years. In 1682, when William Penii
assumed possession of his purchase in the peninsula, this
strip of territory was connected with the mainland. During
the early port of the nineteenth century, however, a ditch
was dug on its landward side. Through the action of the tide



436 MIDDLE srJTES AND MARYUND



this ditch has become a channel. The island is about forty
miles long and a mile wide, one-third of it being in Dela-
ware and the rest in Maryland. In former years the
abundance of wild celery made it the feeding grounds for
canvas-back ducks, but the entrance of the ocean through
the artificial channel killed the wild celery at the head of
the bay. Now the only game the island affords is quail and
beach birds.

A word or two concerning the later history of this scene
of one of the most interesting surveys in the records of the
two provinces of Maryland and Pennsylvania may not prove
altogether uninteresting. The point where the boimdaiy
line between Maryland and Delaware cuts the coast is
marked approximately by the FenwicVs Island lighthouse.
This lighthouse is a tower eighty feet high, showing a flash*
ing light. It was erected in 1857, to protect shipping from
the shoal that extends out into the ocean about twelve miles.
Many vessels had been driven upon the shoal in foul
weather, and the place had come to be considered dangerous.
There may be seen at present old hulks upon the beach in
different stages of decay, silent proofs of the former dangers
of the coast. Yet, notwithstaiidiiig the existence of the
lighthouse and a lightship and a foghorn on the shoals, the
International Line steamship Rhyniand ran ashore near this
spot in the winter of 1898.

There are some of Maryland's sons whom history has
failed to give the importance due them. There are others
deserving of notice who have not been mentioned at alL
Among the latter is Thomas Fenwick, from whom Fen-
wick's Isknd derived its name. He was one of those
restless, adventurous men who emigrated from England to
Maryland during the latter part of the seventeenth century,
but not to worship according to the dictates of their con-
science. His object was the betterment of his very much
impaired fortunes. He had the fibre of a man, but not the
making of a martyr. He was one of those practical, close-
grained pioneers who made possible a successful struggle

with the forests and savages of the New WoiI&lt;L Both
kinds of men were necessaiy for the successful es tablish-
ment of the colony — nen who would sacrifice their lives
for the sake of consdence, and men who were not afraid
to lose their lives in pursuit of their fortunes. Colonial
Maryland developed men of both types.

Fenwick took up a grant of land between what is now
Little Assawoman Bay and the ocean. At that time, and
up to a century 1^0, this narrow strip of land fringing the
ocean was cut by three inlets. The northernmost was called
the Lhtle Assawoman Inlet, the southernmost Green River,
and ahout midway between the«;e wa&lt;; Rinepiixent Inlet.
All three have been filled up tor nearly a century. It seems,
in fact, that the island is gradually rising. Fenwick's Island
lighthouse stands very near the centre of this grant secured
by 1 homas Fenwick.

Fenwick was a prt)minent man in local affairs and is
frequent Iv mentioned in the records of Sussex County,
Delaware, and Worcester County, Maryland. It must be
recalled that his grant lay at the centre of that territory the
possession of wluch was hotly disputed by Lord Baltuaore
and William Penn. Under the proprietorship of the latter,
Fenwick held the positions of sheriff and notary public, and
filled seven! minor offices. During the latter part of his
life he took up his residence at Lewestown, DeUware,
where he died and is supposed to have been buried. At his
death the island passed into the possession of his daugliter^
Mary, who married William Fassett about 1735.

Tliis Fassett waa a bold, seafaring man, and in one of
his ventures was captured by the pirates that thickly in-
fested the coast during the latter part of the seventeenth
and the early part of the eighteenth centuries. These
pirates made coastwise traffic dangerous and frequently made
raids upon the coast, as several chainballs discovered on
Fenwick's Island earlv in the last century testify. When
just off this Inland, and not far from shore, the pirates threw
Fassett overboard to avoid the expense of keeping him.

The beach being waAy^ and Fassett being a good swimmer,

he succeeded in getting ashore, after an exhausting battle
with the tide and surf. Tradition has it that upon landing
Fassett vowed he would spend the rest of his life in en-
deavoring to become the possessor of the island upon whose
hospitable beach he had been cast. Fortune smiled upon
him far more graciouslv thnn he had ever dreamed it would.
He married Mary Fcnwick and secured the island. On
the mainland, not far from Fenwick's Island, arc the scenes
of the childhood of Stephen Decatur, the gre at American
commodore. He was horn at Sincpuxent, iVlaryland, Jan-
uary 5, 1779, and was killccl in a duel with Coininodore
James Barron, in March 22, 1820, at Bladcnsburg, Mary-
land. Likewise, the Hon. John Mlddleton Clayton, who
negotiated the famous Bulwer-Clayton treaty with the Brit-
ishf was bom at Dag^borough, Sussex County, Delaware,
July 24, 1 796. Dagsborough was a part of General John
Dagwofthy's grant and for that reason it was so called. In
deeds recorded prior to 1785 It was called Blackfoot Town.

After the close of Queen Anne's War by the Peace of
Utrecht in 1713) there was a long peace of over a quarter
of a centur)', during which the ocean was free from priva-
teers and the borders of the colonies were not threatened
by the French and the Indians. The next war began in
1744 and was called King George's War. It jrrcw out
of the dispute as tO the Austrian succession and ended with
the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in October, 1748. Maryland
suffered some little disturbances during this war, as a result
of actual and threatened attacks of the French and In-
dians upon unprotected English colonial border settlements.
Three companies were sent to Albany to cooperate in the
proposed conquest of Canada* The crown made the usual
requisition for money. This time the money was demanded
to pay the Maryknd troops until Parliament could defray
the whole bill. The Assembly declined to make the appnn
priation, on the ground that the province had raised troops,
provisioned, and transported them.

Charles Calv«rt, fifth Lonl Baltiiiioce, died in April,
1 751, and was succeeded by his son Fiederick, the sixth
and last baron. Frederick had none of the good quilt-
ties of his fiunily, hut was degenerate in character to such
an extent that hb acts bordered very closely upon the
criminal. He regarded his province merely as a source of
revenue for the satisfaction of his low pleasures. He never
visited Maryland. The population of the province at this
time was approximately ninety-four thousand, not includ-
ing thirty-six thousand negroes. Iron furriaces had been
set !ip, and pig iron was shipped to England. Tobacco,
corn, furs, and lumber were the staple exports. About
twenty-eight thousand hogsheads of tobacco and one hun-
dred and fifty thousand bushels ot wheat were annually
exported. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War
the province may be said to have been in a fairly prosper-
ous condition. But the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was
merely formal and did not even amount to a conipletc
cessation of hostilities in Ann nca. Prance continued her
aggressions along the livci valleys of the north and the
west, and in 1755 the colonies were precipitated into what
is known as the Old French and Indian War. The fol-
lowing year hostilities hroke out in Europe, where this war
was known as the Third Sileslan, or Seven Years' War.

Shortly after the dispute concerning the £ng|idi statutes
was settled in favor of the people, Maryland experienced a
marked industrial improvement. Prior to about lyjs, the
pbnter had raised tobacco almost exclusively, but after that
date wheat and com were grown somewhat extensively.
Settlements were made in the remote parts of the province,
roads were cleared, bridg;es were built, towns spiang up,
and the ^ facilities for a social and commercial intercourse
were thereby gfeatly increased." Prior to this industrial
change, the homes were few and scattered, and the inhabit*
ants lived by themselves with their servants. Except along
the water front, the people held little communication with
each other. Later, everything was very much changed.

There were the county scats, where the courts met and
where men gathered together and exchanged ideas. Here
they discussed the latest news and reviewed experiences
conccrnine many things. This, of course, had a tendency
to develop tile social side of their natures and to make them
something more than the isolated planters of former years.

Like some af the other provinces, Maryland was settled
by different nationalities. Not only did the English come,
but likewise the Germans, Swedes, Italiails, and French,
drawn there no doubt by the mild climate and by the
absence of religious persecution. Some of them were edu-
cated and some were not. Many of them were ^ indented
servants," who, after their term of service, became free,
took up land, and mingled to a certain extent with the other
inhabitants. This varied population undoubtedly presented
strongly marked peculiarities. There was a fairly well-
marked contrast and distinction in classes, which developed
an aristocracy, somewhat tempered and subdued, however,
by the constant infusion of material derived from the re-
demptioners. The aristocratic landholder kept somewhat
aloof from the lower classes and did not mingle with them
socially. There was some little distinction, even in dress.
Nevertheless, uiidei neath all this class distinction there seems
to have been a general sense of equality.

Although a few of the first colonists were educated, that
was not, generally speaking, characteristic of the province
as a whole during the colonial period. Those who wanted
their children educated and could bear the expense usually
sent them to England. There were veiy few libraries, even
among the higher classes. William Rind kept a circulating
library at Annapolis, in 1 764, but it was not well patronized.
Among the swamps and in the backwoods illiteracy was
particularly prevalent. Governor Nicholson took the lead
in affording the opportunities of a better education. His
zeal for education had led him to found William and Mary
College in Virfrinia. He had no sooner taken up the duties
of the executive in Maryland than he urged the Assembly

to establish free schools. As a result of his efforts and
liberality. King William School was founded at Annapolis
in 1696. An export duty was Jaid oa furs for the main-
tenance of schools.

The charter which Lord Baltimore tormuLiteH for Mary-
land planted an almost feudal system in America. The
propMctarv was to be at its head, with almost kinglv pre-
rogatives. Under him were the planters, who usually pos-
sessed a large retinue of slaves and servants. Of the laucr
there were three classes, — convicts, indented servants, and
free willers. Those called ^indented servants" are some-
times spoken of as ^redempcioners/' Bjr the term was
meant persons who in lieu of their passage money to America
bound themselves over, by contract, to serve a certain num-*
ber of years. The population of the colonies was greatly
increased by this system. The term^of service varied in
different States. The term of indented service in Maryland
was limited by the act of 1 715, unless an express contract
had been entered into. Servants above the age of twenty-
five were obliged to serve five years ; between eighteen and
twenty-two, six years; between fifteen and eighteen, seven
years; and if under fifteen vcars, they were to serve until
they reached the age of twentv-two. Upon the expiration
of their term of service they became freemen. Their servi-
tude was usually of a verv mild character until the intro-
duction of slavery, when m sotne instances they received
even harsher treatment than the slaves. When their days
of service were over, the master was compelled to give them
fifty acres of land, corn enough to serve a year, three suits
of wearing apparel, and tools with which to wo^* The
female redemptioners were eagerly sought in marriage as
soon as their term of service was completed. The fact that
they had been servants was not counted ag^sC them in any
way. Many citizen* who became distinguished in after years
had been redemptioners, or descendants of redemptioners.

The words "transported" and "apprenticed servant"
during the colonial period had nothing of their present

meaning. Gciualogists arc sometimes misled by them, but
by reason of insufficient exafniiiation. The methods of
English colonization in the seventeenth century are fairly
weU luideistood. A commercia] company, an association^
or an individual secured from the monarch a charter, grant,
or patent for ceruin lands the boundaries of which were
usually vety ill defined. In some instances, the monarch
himself undertook the colonization of his public domains,
giving the direct supervision of affairs to a trusted friend,
who later became the royal governor. Thus, although colo-
nies were settled under royal charter or under proprietaiy
auspices, yet the methods of inducing people to emigrate
were yew much the same in all cases. Where the settle-
ments were not made in consequence of reli^^iotis, political,
or social persecution, they were made under the pressure of
special pecuniary inducements. In the case of iVIarvlaiui,
Cecilius Calvert, the lord proprietary', offered special advan-
tages to those who brought settlcT^. Of course, with the
first expeditions came gentlemen of culture and families
who soi^t the betterment of their fortunes. These men
in turn frequently took advantage of the liberal offer of the
proprietary to superintend other expeditions, for which they
received grants of land with special privileges. Captain
Thomas Comwallys was one of these men. He was one
of the ^nearly two hundred gentlemen adventurers and
their servants" who embarked on the Jrk and the Dwt
with Leonard Calvert, the governor, and George Calvert,
his brother. He and Jerome Hawley were mentioned as
counsellors.

Comwallys almost immediately took advantage of the
liberal offers to those who superintended the settlement of
colonists. Some he brought from F^ngland and others from
the Virginia colony. In many cases he advanced the money
for transportation and the costs of settlement. In con-
sideration of this transportation" the colonists bound
themselves to serve Comwallys as apprenticed servants"
for a stated length of time— usually for four or five years.

DEVELOPMENT OF MARYLAND



Some of tluMe thiit apprenticed were gentlemen of reduced
foituneSf who were perfectly willing to serve in thb manner
antil tb^ bad cancelled their indebtedness. Consequently,
to have M transported apprenticed servants" meant in many

cases merely to have advanced the costs of colonization for
services of this kind. The ancestors of some of the most
prominent Maiyland families came with Comwallys and
under the same conditions. A man would frequently record
that he "transported** his wife. This was done that he
might take advantage of the land (iffrrs of the proprietary.

Another interesting element \\\ the population of rar!v
colonial Man land were the rangers.** They were bands
of adventurous spirits under popularly chosen leaders. They
frequented the remote parts of the province — ^beyond tide-
water, about the falls of the Potomac or the heads of the
Patapsco and the Patuxent, or toward the iiurih ali)ng the
banks of the Susquehanna. They enjoyed the border life,
watched the Indians, took up strayed or unmarked cattle,
captured runaway servants and fugitives from justice, and
. challenged all suspicious persons entering or leaving the
province by land» Later, their pkce was taken by the back-
woodsmen.

The prwtice of sending convicts to Virginia began in thie
reign of James I. It was gradually extended to the other
colonies, and was later regulated and legalized by P^lia-
ment. These convicts were called " seven-year passengers,*'
or **king*s passengers." They were usually sent over by
private shippers, and sold at an advantage. They were not
all hardened criminals; frequently, they were men who had
committed minor offences. Some were political offenders
whom George I. sent over because, as he observed, servants
were few and hard to get in the colonics, and by their labor
and industn,' could increase the value of the province.

It was estimated in 1767 that for ihiitv years past at Kast
six hundred cotivicts a year had been imported into Mai) land.
1 lie number increased so rapidly that it was found necessary
Co make the testimony of one convict good against another. .

The number of murders and robberies committed in the
year 1751 by these convict servants became alarming. This
led to orders by the courts of Baltimore and Anne Arundel
Counties that ^50 security should be given for every con-
vict imported. These orders were later set aside, and in
1 769 the Assembly passed an act relating to the bad prac-
tice. Eveiy master of a ship transporting felons was re-
quired to produce a copy of the record of conviction. Upon
the sale of the felon, this record had to be deposited
with the county clerk by the seller. The purchaser, like-
wise, was compelled to ^ before a justice of the peace in
his county and give security to the extent of £7,0 currency
for the good behavior of the convict. I his security did not
become voxA until after the convict had kept the peace
dtiring the timc&gt; for which he had been transported or during
his re5?idcnfc in the province.

Imprisonment for debt was of frequent occurrence. The
law was mudihed in I 732 by an act which provided for the
release of debtors upon their surrcnderiiig all their prop-
erty upon oath. Toward the latter part of the proprietary
period, from fifty to over one hundred debtors were released
at eveiy session of the Assembly. Later, by reason of the
great increase of imprisoned debtors, the county couns were
given the power to release them.

Another class of people which gave the authorities and
the people of the colony constant trouble was the paupers,
whose ranks were constantly being recruited by servants,
who, having served their terms, were sent out to shift for
themselves. The required present of fifty acres of land and
other gifts upon the expiration of their terms of servitude
were usually squandered in a short time. After that, the
former servants frequently became so poor that the county
had to care for them. In the year 1753 the counties were
allowed six hundred and forty-seven thousand and twenty-
seven pounds of tobacco for the support of the poor. Four-
teen years later, an almshouse was established in each of the
several counties.

CHAPTER XVUI



TH£ FRMHCH AHD INDUN WAR,

The Peace of Atx-&gt;b-Oii|ieUe» which had been con-
cluded in October, 1 748, was not satisfactoiy to cither the
French or the English. The English Goloaies were paurtku-
larly dissatisfied because Louisburg remained in the posses-
sion of the Frcnrh. They realized fully that as long as this
was the case Kngiisvh trade and fisheries on the northeast
coast would be in jeopardy. Nor were the French, on the
other hand, better satisfied, for one of the stipulations of
the treaty was the removal of the people of Acadia. This,
indeed, was a ww bitter draught for the French. It is not
astonishing, thcreiuic, that wc iind French and English
settlers, notwithstanding a so-called declaration of peace,
continually at strife. Boundary lines were fruitful causes of
dispute* Neither the French nor the Eog^sh believed dnt
the peace would be lasting. Eveiytlung, in fiict, portended
an evly renewal of the conflict, and wise men advised
Governor Clinton, of New York, to secure the dominion
of Lake Ontario by foru and by an armed sloop.

Upon the approach of such a crisis, it was perfectly
evident to all those in authority that the Iroquois should be
ccmciliatcd. Brave, enterprising, shrewd, and occupying
as these Indians did a small country of the highest strategic
importance, their friendship was a matter of the greatest
value to the Enghsh. The policy of the English in their
treatment of the Indians had been, for the most part, one
of irriutiou and insult. 1 he policy of the Erench colonists,

445

446 MIDDLE STAtES AND MARYLASD



on the contrary, had been to let no opportunity pas$ to
conciliate the Algonquins in eveiy way possible. Conse-
quently, the latter Indians, who outnumbered their heredi-
tary enemies the Iroquois six to one, were the natural allies
of the French at the outbreak of the war. Nor was it
absolutely certain that the powerful Iroquois would be
unanimous in the espousal of the English cause. Under
ordinary circumstances, they would have allied themselves
with the English, without (juestion, to fight their old enemies
the Algonquins. The had treatment and encroachments
of the English on ihcii lerritory had, however, almost driven
the Iroquois over to the enemy. The fVench, on their part,
lost no opportunity of employing their diplomacy and tact
in widening this breach between the allies. The French
were upon the point of bringing their diplomacy to a success-
ful issue, when they were partially thwarted by Sir William
Johnson.

Sir William imiuted the French in his Indian policy,
and by kindness and honesty in his relations with the Iro-
quois finally won cheit lasting friendship. The Mohawks
adopted him and gave him the rank of ^Sachem." He
exerted his influence over them against the French, and
would have succeeded admirably in his efforts to win them
completely to the Kngli-:h Ikic] not the narrow policy of the
colony thwarted him. 1 Ins eliange of the colony's Indian
policy occurred in 1753, and had the effect of angering the
tribes upon whom the English were most dependent for the
protection of the border against the attacks of the French
and Indians. Johnson, however, applied himself most as-
siduously to bring about a reconciliation, which he realized
better than anyone else was the one thing necessary to pre-
vent an English disaster in the war that everyone knew must
come sooner or later. He was entirely successful in his
efforts, and managed to propitiate the savages at the famous
Ononds^ council fire. The next year saw him a delegate
to the colonial congress at Albany, to which we shall now
turn our attention.

THE FRENCH AND INDIAN ffAR



447



The convention at Aihuiiy tiict at the prompting of the
fioard of Trade, which instructed the royal governors to
treat with the Six Nations and concert genend measures
of defence with reference to the impending French war.
The convention met on June 19, 1754, and its sessions
continued until the 21st of September following. New
Hampshire^ Massachusetts Bay^ Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented
in the convention by twenty-five delegates. Virginia was
represented by TJeutenant-governor James De Lancey, of
New York. In addition to the desire to treat with the Six
Nations with regard to a mutual defence against the French,
there was likewise a somewhat vague expectation on the
part of the dc legates that plans for a closer union between
the English colonics in North America would be presented.
The avowed purpose of the union would be, of course, the
stronger defence of the colonies against all enemies, espe-
cially the French j and the better negotiation of treaties
with the Six Nations.

The representatives of the Six Nations were slow in
arriving, but quick at rebuking the English for their neglect,
and, worse, their bad treatment of them. They favored
union and peace, nevertheless, but found fault with the
colonists for their lack of action. ^You desire us to speak
from the bottom of our hearts, and we shall do it," said
Hendrick,the great Mohawk chief. '^Look at the French,
they are men, they are fortifying everywhere — but, we are
ashamed to say it, you are all like women, bare arid open,
without any fortifications. *Tis your fault, brethren, tliat
we are not strengthened by conquest, for we would have
gone and taken Crown Point, but you hindered us. We
had concluded to go and take it, but we were told it was
too late, and that the ice would not bear us. Instead of
this, you burnt your own fort at Saratoga and ran away
from it, which was a shame and a scandal to you. Look
about your country and see : you have no fortifications about
you, no, not even in this city; 'tis but one step from



448 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTLAND



Canada hither, and the French may easily come and turn
you out of your doors." The disaffection of the league
of the Six Nations was inversely as the number of their
representatives in attendance at the conference. Although
the colonict had provided pretentt in great abundance and
had invited all the tribes, yet there were but one hundred
and fifty warrioiB pieaent. Half of the Onondagas had been
won over to French influence, and even the Mohawks were
in a disaflccted mood. The convention prepared a veiy
careful address, which was delivered to the Indians. It
seems to have had the desired efiisct, for they left in a much
better ftame of mind than they came.

Never had the colonies witnessed an assembly of more
prominent men. There were present from New York,
Lieutcnnnt-&lt;!;ovcrnor James De Lancey, who acted as presi-
dent of the ctjiivention, Joseph Murray, John Chambers,
William Smith, Colonel William Johnson, and Colonel
Myndert Schuyler, cliairman of the Indian commission.
From Massachusetts Bay there were Thomas Hutchinson,
Samuel Wells, John Chandler, Oliver Partridge, and John
Worthingtonj from Connecticut, Lie utcnant-govcrnor Wil-
liam Pitkin, Elisha Williams, and Roger Wolcott; from
New Hampshire, Theodore Atkinson, Richard Wibbird,
Meshach Weare, and Heniy Sherburne, Jr.; from Rhode
Island, Stephen Hopkins and Martin Howard, Jr. Mary-
land sent Benjamin Tasker and Abraham Bmt$i whUe
Pennsylvania sent John Penn, Richard Peters, Isaac Norris,
and Benjamin Franklin, the ^ most benignant of statesmen."
At the Friday morning session, June 2ist, De Lancey sug-
gested that to avoid all disputes about the precedency of the
colonies, they should be named in the minutes according to
their situation from north to south. This sugfrestion was
accepted unanimously. Tt is said, however, that in the
convention hall the delegates sat in the order of their
individual social rank. Peter Wraxall was chosen secretary
of the convention at this session, and took the oath of oiiice
three days later — June 24th.

THE FREHCH JND INDIAN ITAR



449



After a considemtion of the Indian trouble, in which the
Iroquois in a most frank manner changed the English with
neglect and rapacity, the convention considered a plan of

union of the different colonies. All the members felt the
pressing; necessity of some sort of union for the defence of
the interests of the people represented. On Monday after-
noon, June 24th, all the representatives being; present, in-
cluding the president of the convention, Lieutenant-governor
De Lance\ , a motion was passed unanimously that opiiiions
be delivered as to whether a union of all the colonies was
not at that time absolutely necessary for their security and
defence. It was then agreed that a committee should be
appointed, composed of one delegate from each colony
represented at the convention* This committee was to
prepare and receive plans or schemes for the union of the
colonies* Furthermore, chat the committee should have
the power to digest these plans into one general plan for
presentation to die convention* Each colonial delegation
was to select itt own representative on the committee.
The following men were accordingly selected: Thomas
Hutchinson, Massachusetts Bay; Theodore Atkinson, New
Hampshire; William Pitkin, Connecticut ; Stephen Hopkms,
Rhode Island; Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania; Benjamin
Tasker, Maryland. The selection of New York's repre-
sentative was left to the lieutenant-governor. He appointed
William Smith. At the Fritiay aiternoon session of the
convention, June 28th, the committee distributed among
the delegates » Short Hints" of a plan of union* The fol-
lowing afternoon, these Hints'* were the subject of con-
siderable debate, but the convention was unable to arrive
at any conclusion with r^ard to them. On the following
Monday morning, July I St, another motion was passed,
authorizing the same committee to draw up a representa-
tion of the state of the colonies at that time. The com-
mittee made a full report on the subject on the following
Saturday morning, July 6th. The report was laid upon the
table until the following Tuesday afternoon, when it was

adopted. At the morning session on Tuesday, July 9th,
the plan of the union was debated and agreed upon, and
Benjamin Franklin was requested to make a draft of it.

On Wednesday morning, July loth, Franklin reported the
finished draft, which was read and considered parafjraph by
paragraph. After some amendments had been agreed upon,
the plan was accepted by all the commissioners except those
of Connecticut.

Franklin had some time prior to the convention formu-
laud a plan, which had been favorably spoken of by some
friends in New York. This plan, which he called Hints,"
served as the foundation for the completed plan which the
convention finally accepted. The union was to include
New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,. Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These were
all the British colonies at that time in North America, except
Geofgia and Nova Scotia. Another plan had been pro-
posed in the convention, which included only New Hamp-
shire, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New
York, and New Jersey. Furthermore, it would seem bv the
"Hints" communicated to Mr. Alexander, of New ^ ork,
by Franklin, that the latter himself did not at first contem-
plate anything more than a union of the northern colonies.

The plan as iiiially adopted provided for one general
government. Each colony, however, was to retain its own
domestic constitution, except in certain particulars. At the
head of the general government there was to be a president-
general, who was to be appointed and supported the
crown. In conjunction with him there was to be the Grand
Council. Its members were to be chosen by the House of
Representatives of the Assemblies of the different colonies.
In this popular body, Massachusetts Bay was to have seven
representatives, New Hampshire two, Connecticut five,
Rhode Island two. New York four, New Jersey three,
Pennsylvania six, Maryland four, Virginia seven, North
Carolina four, South Carolina four^ — a total of forty-eight.

These numbers could be changed aiici the union was in
force fur three years, but should never exceed seven, nor
be less than two, for each colony. Phibulelphia was to be
the tempoiaiy seat of the proposed federal government, on
account of its central location. It was thought that the
representatives could reach Philadelphia even from New
Hampshire and South Carolina in fifteen or twenty days.
The time of the meeting was left to the president-general.
There was to be an election for the Grand Council every
three years. That body was to meet once a year, but oftener
if the executive head should deem it necessaiy. It was to
choose its own speaker and was not to sit longer than six
weeks at any one time, except by its own volition or by
the special command of the crown. Nor could it be pro-
rogued or dissolved, except in the same way. Each mem-
ber was to be paid ten shillings sterling per day while the
Assembly was in session. Likewise, during the joui jicy to
and from the place of meeting — twenty miles being reck-
oned as a day's journey. In case of the president-general's
death, the speaker of the Giand Council was to act in' his
place until the down appointed a successor. The sepa-
rate duties of the president-general and Grand Council, and
likewise their mutual duties, were carefully oudined.

The provisions of the plan presented a compromise be-
tween the prerogative and popular power. The president-
general was to have a negative on all laws, but the origination
of ail bills was left with the Grand Council. The repre-
sentation of each colony in the Grand Council depended
upon its contributions, but, as we have seen, a maximum
and a minimum representation were established. All mili-
tary officers were to be nominated by the president-general,
subject to the advice of the Grand Council. All civil offi-
cers, in turn, were to be nominated by the Grand Council.
It required the joint order of the prcsident-2;cneral and
the Grand Council before money could be issued. It was,
however, to regulate all relations of peace or war with the
Indians, land purchases outside of the particular colonies.

and matters of tiade. Furdiermore, it could establish, or&lt;-
ganisCf and temporarily govern new settlements; it could
raise soldiers, equip war vessels, make laws, and levy just
and equal taxes.

The plan as thus finally drawn up was reported to the
Board of Trade and to the Assemblies of the colonies for
adoption. England considered it too democratic, and hence
the Board of Trade did not approve of it. Neither did the
Assemblies adopt it, as they considered that it embodied too
much royal prerogative. Franklin remarked upon one occa-
sion that he thought his plan must have been just about
right, inasmuch as both England and the colonies rejected
it, for diametrically opposite reasons. He says in his auto-
biography: "Its fate was singular: the Assemblies did not
adopt it, as they thoun;ht there was too much prerogative
in it, and in England it was judged to have too much of
the democratic." Although the plan failed of adoption, it
was most productive of good results. It no doubt helped
to cultivate the idea of anion among the colonies, which
germinated at that time and took root and grew until years
after it developed into maturity during the Revolution.

The colonies rejected Fianklin^s plan of union for very
much the same reason that they paid Ittde or no attention
to the plan of union of William Penn In 1697, and opposed
the Andros consolidation scheme of x688. The times were
not ripe for such a radical intercolonial project; America
had been settled by people of too diverse nationalities and
religions, and their settlement had been too recent, for them
to have overcome entirely all their national pitjudices.
Many colonists still maintained to a certain extent die cus-
toms, preconceptions, and religions of their native lands. It
would take time to soften the characteristics of the different
nationalities and make them one in their love for their
adopted country. Besides, there was the ever present fear
of Parliamentary and royal tj'ranny, either direct or through
representatu e governors. And, more to the point, thcie
were the numerous jealousies between colony and colony.

All feared the possible encroachments of Parliament or the
crown, and each envied all the others any signs of unusual
prosperity. Jealousy and penuriousness were the two really
potent causes of the downfall of the New England Con-
federation. 1 hey had likewise considerably to do with
bringing about the rejection of Benjamin Franklin's plan.

Desire far a relatively greater power in the Aasembly of
the New England Confederation on the part of each colony,
combined with a relatively decreasing inclination to bear a
proportional share of its financial burdens, brougjht about
the Confederation's downfall* In the last analysis, the
intercolonial jealousies that were instrumental in defeating
Franklin's plan were founded upon similar causes. These
jealousies, combined with the diversities of nationality,
made the consolidation of the English colonies at that time
and under those circumstances impossible. But Franklin
was not discouraged. His plan of union broadened as he
grew older, until it comprehended '''■the great country back
of the Appalachian Mountains." He said: "In less than a
century it must become a populous and powerful d ominion."

The Albany convention was held none too soon, and the
league of the Six Nations was conciliated none too eflectu-
ally. The relations between England and France were so
strained in North America by reason of conflicting interests
that a formal declaration of war was not necessary to pre^
cipitate hostilities. The very next year (i 755), a year before
war was formally declared, witnessed the threatened out-
break. In May, 1 756, Austria and France completed a
defensive alliance, and England found herself allied with
Frederick of Prussia, who was opposed by very nearly all
the powers of northern Europe. The English plan of
campaign against France in America was the organiza-
tion of the three expeditions, one to operate against Fort
Du Quesne, another against Niagara, and a third against
Crown Point. Acadia, or Nova Scotia, was to be put into
such a condition of defence as to render it proof against
capture.

MWDIS STATES AND MARTUND



The £nglish government, aroused by the defeat of Wash-
ington in the Ohio country and his capitulation to the
French on July 4, 1754, had determined to take more v!g;or-
ous means of protecting itself against the encroachments
of the P rench. It sent two regiments to America under the
command of Major-general Edward Braddock. He sailed
from the Downs for Virginia, on the 21st of December, in
the Centurion^ a ship almost as famous among English sailors
as Nelson's Victory, It was to be followed as soon as pos-
sible by the main body of the fleet. The intelligence of
Braddock's arrival was at first received with enthusiasm by
the colonies of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania as the
signal for speedy defeat of the French. Braddock was a
thoroughly well-seasoned soldier, but knew as little about
the methods of warfare with savages as he knew much
about the set forms of continental warfare. His first official
act on reaching Virginia was to summon the governors of
the colonies to meet him in congress at Alexandria. Here,
the governors of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsyhnnin,
Maryland, and Virginia assembled in April, pursuant to
the call, and proceeded to discuss plans for the summer's
campaign. Mucli indignation was expressed by Braddock
at the failure of the Assemblies to raise the money required
for the campaign. The governors explained the difficulties
they always experienced in persuading the Assemblies to
appropriate money for the common defence. They further-:
more volunteered the opinion that the people would not take
action of their own accord, but would acquiesce in a tax
laid upon them by Parliamentary act. Inasmuch as the
£nglish government had long since determined upon the
policy of raising in the colonies a general fund for the im-
mediate necessities of the impending war, this advice of the
governors is extremely significant when viewed in the light
of subsequent events.

Braddock seemed to be incapable of acting in a tactful
manner. Every move he made was well calculated to
arouse the resentment of the colonists. One of the most

fertOe causes of disa^Ktion was bis cnfoiccnient of a ivgu*
]adoii that bad been promulgated before bis arrival. It was
that the general and lidd officen of the American milhta
should have no rank when those of the cegMlar Eritisb
army were in the Held. He liltewise dedaied that the sav-
ages might put to fligbt the raw American troops, but that
they would make no impression upon the seasoned, well-
disciplined British regulars. This attitude on the part of
Braddock was not calculated to bring harmony into the ranks
of his forces. He also found considerable fault because
progress had not been made on thc^ r md which he expected
would be cut from the SusquclKiii iia, lu low the junction of
the Juniata to tlie forks of the YolJli:hlo^lK nv. He was de-
peruliiK'; upon this road for the transportation of flour and
other stores from Philadelphia for the support of the army.
I inally, the Pennsylvania Assembly, realizing the advan-
tage it would be to have direct commuiucation with Fort
Du Quesne, began the work of construction. Even then,
however, the Assembly was not willing to pay half the
amount it cost to construct the road.

Braddock now proceeded to prepare a plan for the cam-
paign. The troops were to be mobiliaed at Fort Cum-
berland, and it was expected that the Forty-fouitb and
Forty-eighth Regiments would be incieased to seven hun-
dred each 1^ enlistments from Pennsylvania. This expecta-
tion never materialized. Governor Morris, of Pennsylvania,
was requested to ofier a bounty of to eveiyone that
enlisted. The governor did what he could to assist the
campaign, but he was greatly handicapped by the half-
hcrirted measures adopted by the Assemblv. For this reason,
matu of the Pennsylvanians enlisted under northern com-
manders or offered themselves for service in Virginia and
New York.

Before startintj out f&gt;n hfs c ampaign, Braddock carefully
inspected the tuininissat v ai lungements niade for his army.
The disclosures were indeed disheartening. He had ex-
pected Maryland and Virginia to furnish twenty-five hundred

456 MtDDLM STJtMS JND MARrUND



hones, two hundred and Hfty wagons, and eleven hundred
beeves. Instead, he found that only twenty wagons and
two hundred horses had been sent, and the provisions fur-
nished by Maryland, on inspection, proved to be utterly
worthless. Through the energy of Benjamin Franklin, the
deficiency was finally made up from Pennsylvania. Brad-
dock set out from Alexandria with his army on the 8th and
9th fif Mav. On acc(nint of the roughness of the roads,
the route unguialiy determmed upon was somewhat changed.
On the 20th of May he collected all his forces at Will's
Creek. The ranks of the Forty-fourth and Forty-eighth
Regiments were increased by men from Maryland and Vir-
ginia. In addition to these forces there was a troop of
provincial light horse and a detachment of sailors with a
half-dozen officers. The light horse troop had formeily
served as Bniddock's bodyguard, and the nulors and their
officers were furnished by Commodore Rapel. The sailors
were to assist in building bridges. The strength of the
force was two thousand and ^rty-seven, in addition to
the company of light horse, the saOors, and the Indians.
The number of the savages was a very uncertain quantity,
as but few remained with Braddock to the end. There
were about two hundred sailors, which made the grand total
two thousand two hundred and Hfty. The army was ill sup-
plied with provisions, the officers sharing with the men the
scantinc^*; of food. Through Franklin's influence, some of
the money which had heen appropriated by Pennsylvania
was used to supplv the subalterns with camp supplies. The
Lower Counties on the Delaware contributed fat oxen and
sheep for the support of the army.

At Will's Creek, or Fort Cumberland, as Braddock nanicd
the place in honor of his patron, the troops were put under
rigorous disciplmc. Much time was spent in drillii^g and
making preparation for the one hundred and thirty miles of
wilderness that must be penetrated before Fort Du Quesne
could be reached. Trees had to be felled, roads made, and
bridges constructed. The confluence of the MonongaheU

and the Youghiogheny wis finally reached, and the river
was forded at the mouth of Turtle Creek on the 8th of
July. The severest militaiy discipline was exacted, even
in these wilds where the path was but twelve feet fnm the
river hank to the hillside. Flanking parties and guides had
been provided, but the one impoitant thing needed in the
wilderness was lacking — namely, scouts.

When Contrecaeur, the commandant, saw the English
advance, fifteen hundred strong, right at hand, he was for
giving up and retreating immediately. One of his captains,
however, Beaujeu bv name, asked permission to go out
with a company to prt. pare an ambuscade tor the English.
Contrecceur c^&gt;iist lurci, and Beaujeu won the support of
the Indians by repruachiiig them with cowaiti ce. Early
on the niurning of |ulv Q, 1 755., the two huiKlrtd and
thirty French anJ Caiiadiarii* and the six hundred and thirty-
seven red men left Fort Du Quesne under command of
Beaujeu, Dumas, and Ligneris.

The meeting between the French and English forces was
unexpected to both. The Indians threw themselves flat on
the ground or got behind trees or rocks, and remained almost
invisible to the foe during the whole engagement. The
English, on the other hand, foolishly followed the Old
World military uctics, and in their bri^t scarlet miiforms
and compact ranks presented a fine target for the unerring
bullets of the Indians. The militia fought bravely, although
greatly exhausted by the long marches and the unaccustomed
discipline. The officers showed great courage, the general
himself having had four horses shot under him before suc-
cumbing to his wnnnd&lt;;. WnshiiiLi^ton, who was serving on
Braddock's statt, was shot through his coat four times and
had two chargers killed under him. He was practically the
only active officer toward the end of the engagement. By
the latter part of the afternoon, the English were surrounded,
and ammunition had almost failed, yet still Braddock re-
fused to surrender. But further resistance proved futile.
Every aide except Washington was incapacitated, and a

large majority of the officers and nearly two-thirds of the
army were killed or wounded. Braddock then f»rdered a
retreat, which snon developed into a headlong flight,
" Despite all the ertorts of tb?- officers to control," said
Washington, "they ran as sheep pursued by dogs, and it
was impossible to nillv them." Braddock himself had re-
ceived a mortal wound and died several days after, and was
buried by the wayside. On hearing of the disaster, Dunbar
dettrojred all his scores and ammunition at Fort Cumber-
land and abandoned the place. The defeat caused conster-
nation in England and brought the colonies to a realization
of their perilous position. The Virginia House of Bur-
gesses voted ;^40,000 and the Pennsylvania Assembly
^^50,000 for the defence of the colonies. Other colonies
promised men and arms, according to their ability. The
defeat, moreover, caused those Indians who had been waver-
ing in their allegiance to the English to declare for the
French.

In 1758 a second, and this time a successful, attempt
was made to capture Fort Du Qiiesne. John Forbes, who
had been appointed the year previous brigadier-general, was
transferred to Pennsylvania for the purpose of retrieving the
ground lost by the defeat of Braddock. His forces num-
bered about seven thousand men. Washington commanded
the forces from Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina;
while Lieutenant-colonel Henry Bouquet, a Swiss, com-
manded the regulars, and the men from Pennsylvania and
Debware. Forbes, who was detained in Philadelphia on
account of illness, did not reach Raystown, or Fort Bed-
ford, until September. His weakness had been increased
by the long journey, but he went on until he reached the
camp of Loyalhanna, November 5th. After a council of
war was held, it was decided to go no further. Later, how-
ever, upon learning that many of the Indians had deserted
the French in the fort, and that the commandant, Ligneris,
on account of lack of provisions, had sent some of his men
away, this decision was reversed. In spite of the fact that

the provisions were nearly exhausttcl, Forbes decided to send
Washington to take the fort. The French, of five hundred
men, finding themselves far outnumbered and destitute of
means to defend themselves against a siege, set fire to the
fort and decamped. When Washington arrived the next
day, there was nothing left htit a smoldering ruin. A stock-
ade was then built and all the provisions that could be spare d
were collected, and two hundred men were detached from
the troops and left behnid to take charge of the fort, which
Forbes had renamed Fort Pitt. Early in December, Forbes
began his march eastward. He succeeded in reaching Phiia-
dclphia, but died in the following March.

Braddock's defeat was indirectly responsible for the fail*
uie of a contemplated expedition ag^st the French fortress
at Niagara. This fort was weak and partly dismantled,
but owing to its strategic situation it was important that it
should fiJl into the hands of the Eng^sh, It was a centre of
the lur trade and touched hands widi both the east and the
west. To William Shirley was assigned the duty of taking
the fort, and it was expected that, after a victory at Fort
Du Quesne, Brad Jock's army would join him at that place.
Braddock^s defeat, however, combined with obstacles in the
way of the project, both natural and artificial, led to the
abandonment of the attempt in October, 1755* Oswego
was rebuilt and garrisoned.

The reverses of 1755 were partly balanced by the suc-
cesses of William Johnson. Hi-^ objective was the capture
of Crown Point, which comniaiKlcd the highway into New
France. The Marquis dc Vaudreuil, realizing the impor-
tance of holding Crown Point, gave Dieskau seven hundred
regulars, one thousand six hundred Canadians, and seven
hundred Indians for a garrison. Johnson had about three
thousand four hundred raw colonial troops and Indians.
The opposing forces met on September Sdi, on the shores
of what is now known as Lake George, but at that time
Lac Saint-Sacrement. Only one thousand four hundred of
the French and one thousand of the English were in the

engagement. The English ci lonial troops fought bravely,
and the French were completely defeated. The French
regulars were annihilated, and Dieskau was wounded and
captured. Johnson built (1755) a strong fort on the shore
of Lake George. He named it Foft WUloim Henry and
gave Fort Lyman the name of Fort Edward, both names
being given in honor of two of the king's grandsons. The
Eng^sh government showed its appreciation of Johnson's
success by granting him £$^000 and conferring upon him
the title of baronet. The year following (1756), the Karl
of Loudon was put in command of the military forces
in America, with Major-general Abercrombie ns second in
command. They were given power independent of the
colonial governors and had authority to quarter soldiers
without the consent of the colonial Assemblies.

Great Britain made a formal declaration of war on May
18, 1756, and in June Abercrombie arrived and at once
quartered his troops on the people of Albany. Loudon did
not arrive until late in July. Montcalm had been in the
meantime put in command of the French interests, and with
the Chevalier de Xj^is, the second in command, and the
adjutant Bougainville had reached Quebec in May. Mont-
calm showed commendable energy by laying siege to and
capturing on August 14th the English post at Oswego.
Loudon replied to this French challenge by retreating
almost precipitately to New York. Cautious man that he
was, he took care to protect his retreat from a force half as
large as his own by throwing the trunks of trees across the
trail. His conduct was in marked contrast to that of Cap-
tain John Armstrong, a Scotch-Irish Covenanter of Cum-
berland. At the head of a party of colonists, he penetrated
the wilderness and almost exterminated a force of Delaware
Indians that had been ravaging the frontiers of Pennsylvania.
The ammunition the savant s had stored was destroyed and
eleven white captives were rescued,

Loudon next planned an expedition against Louisburg.
By June of 1757, he airived at Halifax, where during the

next mondi be was joined hy a squadmn from En^and
with additional foicet. It was then leaned that the French
weie at Loiiisbiiig, in fbice prepared to meet the expected
attacks. Again Loudon turned toward New York, this
time at the head of ten thousand troops and nxteen ships
and firigiles. Thb expedition was the main cause of the
horrible massacre of the Eng^ ganison at Fort William
Hearyi lor, learning of it, Montadm gathered an armjr of
etg^ thousand Indian, Canadian, and French troops, and
on Attgyst xst set out from Ticonderog^. Four days later
the investment of Fort William Heniy was begun, Colonel
Munni, of the Thirty-fifth Regiment, was in command.
His ganison numbered some two thousand two hundred
and sixty-four men — a force not much more than a fourth
as strong as that of the attacking French.

The garrison was able to hold out five days, having in
the meantime suffered a loss of three hundred killed and
man\' more disabled by wounds and by an epidemic of
sm;i!Ipox. Oil the 9th of August, not having received aid
from Colonel W ebb, who with upward of four thousand
troops was within relieving distance, Munro surrendered.
He received honorable terms, and the garrison marc hed
out of the fort with the honors of war. Montcalm used
every effort tu huld the Indians to the terms of capitula-
tion, but as soon as they got within the wails of the fort
they began their owii horrible war practices. The sick
and wounded of the English were murdered j and not bcuig
satisfied with this shedding of blood, the Indians turned
their fury upon the £ngli&amp; soldiers. Montcalm and the
French officers succeeded in keeping the savages in check
for a time, but hter they broke all bounds and continued
the massacre. The Indians killed about seventy, including
sick and injured, and made prisoners of about two hundred
men* Most of the captives the French redeemed later.

Loudon, as the head of English militaiy a&amp;irs in North
America, had proved himself an absolute fiulure. He spent
most of his time in making plans for great campaigns or

planning^ bow he could best keep an enemy of half his own
Strength from successfully preventing his retreat. At last
his inefficiency became clearly apparent to all, and he was
recalled. Under his kadcfship ihc ''depth of degradation
had been sounded." Said Pitt : Nothing is done, nothing
18 attempted. We have lost all the waters; we have not a
boat on the lake. Eveiy door is open to France." The
French controlled most of the continent. Upon Loudon's
recall, Abercrombte, the second in command, took his place.
Aided by Wolfe and Amherst, he was to conduct the
operations in the north. Louisburg was to be reduced,
and this success was to be followed up by the capture of
Quebec. Ticonderoga was to be destroyed, thus relieving
the northern colonies of the constant danger from invasion,
and the way westward was to be opened by the capture of
Fort Du Qijcsne.

The man who infused this new life into English colo-
nial affairs was William Pitt. In 1757, he had strongly
opposed the Hanoverian policy of the king and was de-
prived of office. But king, aristocracy, and people soon
discovered that the nation could not do without him, and
he was ag^in placed in power. The people enthusiastically
supported him, because he stood for everything opposed to
the narrow, venal policy of the Duke of Newcastle, and
because he had constantly in mind the interests of the
people and the welfare of the nation. He laid his plans for
the betterment of afiiurs in America, and a change was soon
apparent. As we have seen, he immediately placed capable
men in charge of the war in the colonies.

Pitt rejected the coercive policy adopted by his prede-
cessor toward the colonies, and invited New England, New
York, and New Jersey to raise as many troops as possible.
He expressed himself as believing that they were well able
to furnish at least twenty thousand for the expedition against
Montreal and Quebec. Pennsylvania and the Southern
colonies were to assist in the conquest of the west. It was
thought that England would provide arms, ammunition, and

tents, and in time iiiiLzht be prevailed upon to grant a proper
compensation for any advance made by the colonies. Noth-
ing was to be required of the colonies but "the levying,
clothing, and pay of the men.*' He fiirthemiore obtained
an order from the king making every provincial officer not
above the rank of colonel equal in command with the offi-*
cers of the regular army, ^according to the date of their
respective commissions." Pitt's fair and liberal treatment
of the colonists had its immediate satisfying results. The
contributions from the colonies, especially from those of
New England, even exceeded the premier's expectations.

Early in the spring of 1758, Pitt sent a fleet in command
of Admiral Edward Boscawen, with Amherst :ind Wolfe. It
consisted of twenty-two line-of-battie ships, httcen frigates,
and about ten thousand effective troops. After a long and
stormy voyage, the expedition reached Halifax on May 28th.
On June 7th Louisburg was reached, and on July 26th it
was taken.

While the fleet was before Louisburg, a large army was
being mobilized on the shores of Lake George. There
were six thousand three hundred and sixty-seven British
regulars and nine thoufond and twenty-four American
provincials, mostly from New England, New York, and
northern New Jersey. The nominal commander-in-chief
of this force was Abercrombie, but the moving spirit of the
enterprise was Viscount Howe. On the 5th of July, the
armament moved down the lake. After the foot of the lake
was reached, a four miles* advance upon Ticonderoga was
begun. In the \ cry first skirmish Viscount Howe was killed,
and from that moment the life of the expedition seemed to
have departed. Abercrombie was rimid and irresolute. The
attack upon the enemy's intrcnchnicnts resulted in a crimi-
nal slaugliter of nearly two thousand brave English soldiers.
Montcalm had but a fourth the number of Abercrombie's
army, and yet, owing to the cowardice of the latter, won
a complete victory. Abercrombie did not stop his re-
treat until the lake was between himself and Montcalm^



464 MWDLE STJTSS 4SD MJRVUND



and until the artiUeiy and ammunition were safely lodged at

Albany.

The only redeeming feature of the dcfcnt was a negative
one. It led to the capture oi Von Frontcnac on the 26th
of August. This, in turn, rendered Fort I)u Quesnc
virtually untenable and led later, on the 25th of November,
to its evacuation and destruction by the French. The
capture of 1* ort Frontcnac was effected by three thousand
provincials, of whom more than eleven hundred were New
Yorkers, including the brothers James and Geoi]ge Clinton.
Both these distinguished themselves as militaiy leaders in
the American Revolution and later in the political affairs
of the State of New York. James was die third son and
George the youngest son of Colonel Charles Clinton. James
Clinton greatly distinguished himself in the French and In-
dian War and later in the American Revolution. He was
the father of De Witt Clinton. He became fourth Vice-
president of the United States, and held the office of Gov-
ernor of New York, by successive reelections, for eighteen
years. In iSoi, he wa3 elected for an additional term of
three years.

In the year I759&gt; England seemed to have reached the
very "apogee of her military grandeur.'* PVom every quar-
ter of the world came news of the success of the British
arms. In America, Pitt was loyally supported by every
cdony north of Maryland. New York and New Jersey
were particularly active in volunteering support. Although
New Jersey had lost a thousand men, yet it voted to raise
an additional thousand, and taxed itself for the war yearly
an amount equivalent to about £i from each individuaL
The campaign in America for the year was laid out on a
far-sighted and masterly plan. General Stanwix was to
secure and hold the frontier between Pittsburg and Lake
Erie; Sir William Johnson and Brigadier Prideaux, with
what Indians they could collect, were to liavc Montreal
as their objective point, advancing by Niagara and Lake
Ontario. General Jeffrey Amherst, the newly appointed

commander-in-chief, was to advance with the main army
as far as Lake Champlain and unite with the army of the
St. Lawrence for an attack upon Quebec if a favorable
opportunity offered itself. The capture of Quebec was the
salient feature of the whole phm.

The first move in the campaign was against Niagara.
Two regMnents of English troops with artillery, a battalion
of loyal Americans, and two battalions of New York pro-
vincials, were under the command of Prideaux. In addition
to these forces, there were Iroquois under Sir William John-
son. After detaching garrisons to supply Fort Stanwix and
Oswego, the expedition sailed for Niagara early in July.
The fori was soon iir/ested, and the assniik was begun.
Prideaux was killed early in the attack by the bursting of a
small mortar, and Johnson took his place. A relief party
of one thousand one hundred whites and two hundred
Indians having been completely routed, the garrison was
compelled to surrender.

The 1 rench now began to give way on all sides. They
had lost the whole upper valley of the Ohio; their foils at
Presqu'Ile, Venango, and Lc Bixuf had btcu destroyed by-
themselves. Fort Du Quesne, Oswego, and Niagara had
fallen into the hands of the English, and now, on the 26th
of July, Ticonderoga and, on the ist of August, Crown
Prnnt were evacua^. Stapiifitj is too weak a word to
characterize Amherst in his disposition of his forces after
the successes at Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Jjet tis
put him in the dass with lANidon and Abercrombie; the
association cannot injure the reputation of the ktter two,
and will fiurly well characterize the standing of Amherst.
He should have cooperated with Wolfe before Quebec,
where Montcalm had gathered practtcalljr the whole eftrctive
fighting force of Canada.

Quebec surrendered on the 1 8th of September, 1 759.
After its fidi, the French became demoralized. An attempt '
in 1760 to recapture Quebec failed. The French, under
the Chevalier de Levis, fell back upon Montreal. Here they

made their last and ineffectual stand. On the 7th of Sep-
teniber, 1760^ the city was surrounded, and surrendered the
next day. The Peace of Paris was not signed until three
years after (February 10, 1763), but the fall of Montreal
practically marks the close of the great struggle in America.
The French power was completely overthrown, and the
£nglish colonies were introduced to a new era of colonial
history.

The contrast between the Northern, Middle, and Scmthern
colonics in the interest displayed in the war is indeed most
marked. There was not a battle fought during the years
1759 and 1760 without men from New England, New
York, and New Jersey being found in the ranks. Com-
paratively speaking, Pennsylvania and Maryland took but
slight interest in the progress of the war, after the occupa^
tion of Fort Du Quesne. Further south than Matyland,
the interest was stiU more languid.

A great deal of money was needed to finance the war,
and £e difierent colonies employed different methods of
raising the necessary funds. Great Britain made lafge con'
tributions, but so heavy were the burdens of the war that it
is no disparagement of the mother country to say that the
colonies were obliged to depend for the most part on them-
selves. Some provinces levied taxes, but in Pennsylvania
the money was raised by issuing bills of credit. Var\ ing
amounts of these were authorized from time to time. I hc
issuance of these bills was the occasion of numerous quar-
rels between the Assembly and the governors. Apart from
objecting to the paper currency on principle, the governors
were required to oppose it in royal or proprietary colonics
by special orders of their superiors. They were instructed
not to sign any bills of that character for any reason what-
ever. From the first emission, in 1723, to the last instal-
ment during the provincial administration, the issues of bills
in Pennsylvania a^regated ,3 16,650. In most of the
colonies the value of these bills of credit depreciated greatly.
As to what that depreciation was in Pennsylvania, where the

pa]&gt;cr money was lairly w i ll prott cted by tax levies, it is most
ciitHciiI: U) get a fair esiiniau . f ranklni held that there had
been 110 dcpicciation whatever, lie atiiriiUed, however, that
the Philadelphia merchant was compelled to pay very large
premiums for the specie he was recjuired to truismit to the
foreign mefchantt in payment of liis importations. Never-
theless, this was due, said Franklin, to the scarcity of specie
and did not prove a depreciation in the value of the paper
money. As compared with the value of labor and commodi-
ties, no safe conclusion may be drawn. As compared with
sUvcf , there is no question of the relative depreciation of the
Pennsylvania bills of credit, but it was much less than in
other colonies issuing paper money. Even in the case of
silver, however, it is difficult to form an estimate of this de-
preciation. There was hardly enough specie in the colony to
serve as the basis of a fair comparison of values after foreign
ob]k;ations were cancelled.

On account of the policy of non-resistance which the
Quakers held from the very beginning of the French and
Indian struggle, Pennsylvania became very much disliked
by the other colonies. They did not relish the idea of being
compelled to bear Pennsylvania's share of the burden of war.
Robert Hunter Morris, the Governor of Pennsylvania, did
everything he rnuld to stir the AsM iiibly to a sense of its
duty, but the (^lakcr intiucnce [)i &lt;. Juniinated and httle was
done by that body at the beginning of the struggle, either to
raise money or truups fur the expeditions.

After the defeat of Braddock, the Indian allies of the
French broke all bnunds and massacred even women and
children. The accounts of one horrible massacre after
another tinall) aroused those who had hitherto either given
half-hearted aid or no aid at all, and they quickly made
plans for defence. A Militia Bill was passed without
amendment, which " encouraged and protected voluntary
associations for public defence/' The northwestern fron-
tier was assigned to Franklin, who was given full power to
commission olEcers. With the assistance of his son, who



468 MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND



had served in the army against Canada, Fnuiklin easily suc-
ceeded in raising Hve hundred men. Franklin immediately

began to erect forts and proceeded to complete his plans
for the military association. He was elected colonel of a
regiment in Philadelphia composed of one thousand two
hundred men.

In addition to Franklin's efforts to protect the borders,
the Germans and Scotch-Irish joined forces to compel the
Assembly to take more positive measures. They drew up
a petition and presented it to the Privy Council. A com-
mittee was appointed to look into the charges, which finally
condemned the too peaceful policy of the Assembly. A
further declaration was made that it was the duty of that
body ^to support the government and protect its subjects ^
that the measures enacted by the Assembly for that purpose
wei« inadequate; and that there was no hope for more effect-
ive ones so long as the majority of that body consisted of
persons whose avowed principles were opposed to military
service, although they were less than one-sixth of the popu-
lation." The report, being adopted, caused a stir among
the Qiiakers, a number of whom retired rather than give
assent to a vigorous military policy. Thus matters were
left in the hands of those who did not hold the principle of
non-resistance.

In Maryland, Governor Horatio Sharpe tried again and
again to get the Lower House to vote an appropriation for
the common defence. First, that body refused unless the
revenue should be taken from a tax on licenses. To this
the governor refused to accede, inasmuch as it was an in-
fringement upon the prerogatives of the proprietary. Next,
an appropriation of jCj^ooo was made on condition that
£4^000 of it should consist of a new issue of bills of credit.
Sharpe refused to sign the bill, and smother deadlock was
the result.

The news of Braddock's defeat reached Annapolis on
July 15th. The settlers were reported flying in all direc-
tions, and it was feared that Frederick County would be

entirely depopulated unless some immediate action were
taken for its defence. The Indians were striking terror
into the heart*; of the border settlers. The Assembly finally
came to terms on the threat of the enraged settlers of Fred-
erick County to march upon Annapolis with Thomas Cresap
at their head and compel action. The proprietary agreed,
however, that his own manors should be taxed. A bill
finally passed the Assembly, issuing ;^40,ooo in bills of
credit. It was to be used in " building forts, raising troops,
securing the alliance of the southern Indians, and paying
bounties on Indian scalps." Additional taxes and duties
provided a sinking fund for the redemption of the bills.
Among these was a tax on bachelors, as ^men who were
derelict in a citizen's first duty at a time when it was most
imperative.*'

As soon as the seat of w^ar was transferred to the north,
and when it was evident that it would stay there, the Mary-
land Assembly once more refused to pass supply bills.

Sharpe succeeded in raising some volunteers, who contrib-
uted most effective services ag;ainst the Indians. The evac-
uation of Fort Du Quesne freed the whole province from
danger, and likewise eradicated from the Assembly the little
inclination it had to help the common cause. The Mary-
land troops engaged in the expedition were voted £i^^00y
and then the matter stopped short. There is no disputing
the niggardliness of Maryland's conduct in this war. It
was not equalled by that of Pennsylvania. It is fortunate
that the safety of the American colonies did not depend
upon the generosity of the Maryland Assembly.

Shortly after the settlement of the long-standing boun-
dary dispute between Pennsylvania and Maryland in 1760,
the northern boundary was likewise established. The first
agreement, we recall, was between Lord Baltimore and
Thomas and Richard Pcnn. It was reached on the basis
of the ap;reement of 1732. In 17^3, Charles Mason and
Jeremiah Dixon, two well-known English matheniatici.ins,
began the determination of all those parts of the boundary



470 MIDDLE srJTMS AND MJRriAND

not completed at that time. They were employed by the
proprietaries. First, they determined the northeastern angle
of Maryland, which was to be the starting point, and then
ran a line westward upon the latitude 39° 43' 26.^^" north.
The Indians interrupted the survey in 1767, after it had
been carried two hundred and forty-four miles from Dela-
ware River. Thit was only thirty-six mika east of the
teiminus sought. The line was marked by milestones, and
on eveiy fifth stone the arms of Baltimore were cut on one
side and those of the Penns on the othen Where cut stones
could not be conveyed, cairns were substituted. The part
of the line left unsur\ c\ Ld was fixed in November, 1 782,
by Colonel Alexander Mcl^ean, of Pennsylvania, and Joseph
Neville, of Virginia. It was verified and permanently marked
in 1 784. The survey was revised in 1849 ^7 commissioners
appointed by Mar\ land, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. The
boundary stone at the northeast corner of Maryland had
been rcnio\ed accidentally. The survcv was made by
Licutcnant-coIoncl James D. Graham, ui the United States
topographical engineers. The work of Mason and Dixon
was confirmed, and Maryland gained less than two acres.
This Mason and Dixon Line, as separating the Northern
from the Southern States, was destined to play a veiy
important role in the politics of the nation.

The accession of Lieutenant-governor James De Lancey
to executive control in New York was a fortunate occur-
rence upon the eve of the French and Indian War. Gov-
ernor Geof]ge Clinton had been succeeded by Sir Danvers
Osborne, who arrived on October 10, 1 753. Shortly after,
however, Osborne committed suicide, and two days later
(October 31st) Dc Lancey entered upon the executive au-
thority. He was superseded in that position when Sir Charles
Hardy arrived at New York on September t,^ i 755, but con-
tinued to exercise the real power of the office. New York
had to bear much of the brunt of the struggle, and did it
nobly. At the outbreak of the war in T755, the Assembly
voted ^45,000 in paper money and authorized a levy of eight

Imndred men. Shortly afterward, ^^48,000 was added to this
amount and the force was increased to one thousand seven
hundred men. In 1759 the quota was fuither increased to
two thousand six hundred and eighty, and a bounty of £1$
was ofiered. Likewise, 100,000 in pftper money was 01^
dered, which was to be cancelled in nine annual instalments.

These provisions were but a slight part of the burdens
the people of the province bore. Troops were billeted
upon the citizens, aiid time and time again the war swept
over the borders, caiiying with it all the losses incident to a
French and Indian invasion. New York was, in a large
measure, the hnttlefield of the war. Armies moved across
the province fritrn Ntnv Yfirk t() Lake Champlain nnci from
Alhany to Niagara. Scitiemcnts were broken up, manu-
factures were interrupted, and agriculture and commerce
were checked. The strain upon the province cannot well
be exairc^erated. The effects of the war were evident in the
foUuwing statistics for the year 1756: the white population
was eighty-three thousand two hundred and thirty-three,
and the black, thirteen thousand five hundred and forty-two.
Out of these numberB two thousand six htmdred and eighty
were kept constantly in the field. The war debt in 1762
was more than ;^3oo,ooo, and a tax of ^^40,000 a year was
assessed to meet it.

At the outbreak of the war. Governor Belcher, of New
Jersey, addressed the Assembly on the relations between the
home government and France. The House replied, through
its committee, that New Jersey had no available money
with which to aid the frontier colonies in their expeditions
against the French or their defences against the Indians.
The failure of the expedition against the French on the Ohio
and the return of the troops from Fort Necessity, however,
awoke the Assembly to a realization of the great danger
threatening all the colonics. On April 24, 1755, the gov-
ernor issued a proclamation stating; that the Assemblv had
provided for" Pay,CloathinL%and Subsistence of five hunt! red
Men," to be under the command of Cuionci Feter Schuyler.

The colony seemed thoroughlj aroused. Funds were ap-
propriated by the Assembly, voluntaiy contributions were
made, and by May lath four out of five of the New Jersey
companies were nearly completed. By June, 1756, the

Assembly had appropriated ;^75,000 and had seven hundred
and fifty men in the field. The New Jersey troops met
with a disaster on the 21st of July, 1757, when Colonel
John Parker lost all but seventy-five men of a party of three
hundred and fifty in a water attack upon Fort Ticon-
deroga. The excitement m New Jersey was intense. It
was feared the whole Hudson valley would be wrested
from England.

In 1758 New Jersey recruited a tlUMtsand and in
1760 still another thousand, while in 1761 a force of six
hundred men were recruited for service on the Canadian
border. New Jersey troops were represented in many
of the important battles of the war. They were at the
fall of Quebec and were among the levies of 1762, 1763,
and 1764. No colony acted with greater promptness and
with more genuine unselfishness in providing means for the
common defence than did New Jersey when iinally aroused
to the seriousness of the struggle.

George II. died suddenly on October 25, 1760, and was
succeeded by his grandson, (korge III. The new monarch
had been taught by his inother two things: "to be an
Englishman and to be a king." He made changes in the
cabinet immediately, by way of emphasizing his determina-
tion to rule as well as to reign. He made personal appoint-
ments in the army and the Church, and likewise controlled
many important civil offices in the court and government.
In this way he surrounded himself with men so completely
dependent upon him that they were willing to do anything
and everything he wished. They were truly the "kin^s
friends." Through his influence, tfie Newcastle ministry,
of which Pitt was the real head&gt; was forced to resign in
May, 1762. Pitt had already resigned on October 5th
of the preceding year.

THE FRENCH JND INDIAN IFAR



The Seven Yean' War of Europe, — the Fiench and In-
dian War of America^ — ^which had cott to much money
and to many lives, was brought €o a formal cloae by the
Tieatj of Firis. The Bricijh nation, on the whole, was
opposed to' its terms* Pitt fought ag^nst the clause that
g^ve Fiance a shaie in the fisheries of Newfoundland and
the St. Lawrence. In fact, he was strenuously opposed to
anything that mig|it possibly result in the restoiation of
French maritime power. The terms of the treaty were
briefly as follows : first, all Canada was ceded to the British \
secondly. Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and dependent islands
were likewise given to the British, with the exception of a
share in the fisheries and the possession of two islets. Saint*
Pierre and Miquelon, as a shelter for French fishing vessels;
thirdly, the boundary was to be the middle of Mississippi

of the latter river froin L:^kcs Maurepas and Pontchai triiin

and all Louisiana west of the Mississippi; fifthly, England
acquired Senegal in Africa and the command of the slave
trade; sixthly, in Europe, each country took back its own —
Minorca reverting to Great Britain.

The colonists had gone into the war in a disunited con-
dition, each colonv and province for itself. Those that ^
were not iinnietliatcly aitcctcd h\ the conflict carctl little
how it terminated. The war did not bring them together
exactly, but it taught them that they had numbers, wealth,
and ahiltty, which, when united, could be used widi telling
efiect. The growing senttment of independence, now that
the fear of the French despotic ideas was removed, had
almost untfammeiled opportunity for development. Affec-
tion for the mother countiy had not been increased by the
war. During its course, the British had constantly irritated
the colonists and their troops by the oveibearing and con-
temptuous manner of the genends sent from England. The
constant threat of Parliamentary control of American finances
added to the distrust of England that the war had intensified.

CHAPTER XIX

ASSUUPnON OF PJRLUMENTJRr CONTROL, 1763-1/63

When the sagacious Vcrgcnnes, the French ambassador
at Constantinople, heard of the conditions the Treaty of
Pan*&gt;, he uttered a propht c\ in th( s( words: "The conse-
quences of the entire cessiun oi Canada arc obvious. Eng-
land will well near repent of having removed the only check
that could keep her colonies in awe; they stand iiu longer
in need of her protection j she will call on them to con-
tribute toward supporting the burdens they have helped to
bring on her; and they will answer by striking off all de-
pendence." Said tbe equally sagacious Choiseul : ^ We have
caught them at last/* He beUeved folly that the cession of
Camda would lead to the independence of North America*

The iear of France once removed^ the conflicting ideas
with regard to the power of Pkiiiament over the colonies
were bound to clash. The records of the colonial Assem-
blies are one continuous protest against P^uliamentary^ royal^
or proprietary interference with the right to initiate money
bills. The difficulties experienced by royal and proprietary
governors were in nearly every instance due to disagree^
ments with the colonial leg^latures with regard to appro-
priations. The governors would insist on a stipulated salary
fund for a period of years, or an unitemized budget, and the
Assemblies would just as often oppose it. In nearly every in-
stance the Assemblies finally won a complete victory. Con-
trol of ro]or\ial purses in turn gave them control of almost
all important legislation.

MIDDLE STJTBS AND MARYLAND



The fight was kept up, as we have seen, during the French
and Indian War, when it caused much hard feeling between
the rrprescntativcs of the mother country and the colonial
legislatures. There was lack of interest on the part of the
Southern colonies, almost criminal negligence on the part
of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and a stubborn liberality by
New York, New Jersey, and New England. To undis-
cerning persons, the close of the war seemed to promise a
cessation of the struggle of the people for the control of
their revenues. As a matter of fact, however, the war was
the most important cause of its cuntiiiuaLion. Indeed, the
struggle was to grow even more bitter than before and was
to lead shortly to the great American Revolution. Instead
of conteiting with royal and proprietary governors, the
eolonies had now to deal with Parliament itself. The colo-
nial side of the dispute also became changed. The great
question at issue tended to bring the colonies closer together,
and Parliamentary tyranny brought about a umon between
them. Formerly, the colonies fought their battles individu-
ally, because the power that essayed to infringe upon what
they termed their inalienable rights differed in the seveni
colonies. But after the Seven Years' War, the one gjreat
threatening power was Parliament ; and the colonies, realiz&gt;
ing this, slowly but surely united in their opposition to its
encroach men t&lt;;.

The French and Indian War was the in^mcdiatc r:uise
of Parliamentary aggression upon the control by colonial
Assemblies of their own revenue. This war, beg:un by Eng-
land for the acquKsition of the Ohio valley, doubled the
British national debt, thus increasing it to the amount
of 1 40,000,000. The national supplies during the first
year of peace amounted to 14,000,000. The nation's
lands and industries were overburdened by public charges
to such an extent that the people were afraid -to increase
the debt. In America, the northern colonies likewise were
quite exhausted by reason of their expeditions and their
losses*

To reimburse the colofiiet for at least part of the losses
they had sufoed, Parliament passed an act appropriating
j^l 50^)00 in specie for distribution among the colonies,
Pennsylvania receiving ;^26,ooo as her firK year's grant.
The As^mbly of that colony sent a resolution to its gov-
ernor, continuing Franklin and Charles as its agents in Eng-
land and enabling them to receive the money. The governor
refused to arirrc to the clause authori/ing the irjcnts to'
recei\c the nu)ncy granted by Parliaiiunt. Nevertheless,
the Assembly ordered its agents to take the money and to
deposit it in the Bank of England subject to the drafts of
the province. The money was finally paid to Franklin,
who invested it in English funds. New Jersey received
;^5,OQO, and the Lower Counties [Dciavvarej somewhat
over i^3,ooo. Of the latter amount, the agent was allowed
to retain one-half of one per cent, whUe one-half of the re-
mainder went to New Castle Cbunty, three-tenths to ICent,
and the remaining two-tenths to Sussex* The money was
employed in liquidating the debts contiacced in consequence
of the war.

On account of the large national debt of En^and, her
people thought America should assist In carrying the burden,
particularly as much of it had been created in defending the
colonics. Again, Ponttac's war ( 1 763—1 764) had definitely
shown that the frontier still needed protection. England's
plan was to supply troops to be distributed along the frontier,
for the support of which the colonies were to be taxed.
The British idea was that the colonists in America were
subject to the powers of Padiament; furthermore, that Par-
liament could yield them more or fewer powers of self-
government for a time and then withdraw them at will. It
was claimed that the colonists had representation in Par-
liament, for the reason that the members of the House
represented the whole British Empire rather than a mere
section of it. On the other hand, the colonists claimed that
Paiiiament had no more to do with the colonies tiban the
Assemblies in the colonies had to do with Parliament.

478 MIDDLE STATES AND MARTUND



At this time (1765), the revenues from the colonies
amounted to about 1,900 per year, which cost upward
of ;^9,000 to collect. The government now determined
to get a substantial revenue. There were no longer to be
"requisitions from the king/* but instead the British legis-
lature was to put a tax on the colonies. Hereafter, all
royal officers, not inferior in r:ink tu the executive, were to
be subject to the will of the king. The crown was to ap-
point diem and fix their salaries. They were to sustain the
authority of Great Britain. The Navigation Acts were to
be rigidly enforced. Finally, it was determined that twenty
regiments should be maintained in America, to be supported
by the crown the first year, but afterward by the colonies.

These various policies toward the American colonies
caused several political parties to spring up in England. At
first there were two Whig factions, but when in 1762 Lord
Bute was made prime minister, and Geoige Grenville secre-
tary of state, their attempts to create a court party drove the
Whig factions together. These two Whig factions now
united, and, having the support of the people, bitterly op-
posed the court party. Bute withdrew on April 8, 1763,
and Grenville became prime minister, with Charles Town-
shend as first lord of trade. Townshend ami ( jicnville did
not agree in their opinions, although in the ^anie ministry;
and the former, perceiving that the fall of the ministry was
near at hand, resigned. Thereupon Geoige III* put the
government in the hands of a triumvirate consisting of
Grenville, Egremont, and Halifax. Grenville was no great
favorite of George, but he was selected because he was
dependent on the court. The idea of George and his friends
was that all parties should come together, and out of this
coalition the Jung could choose his ministry.

Parliament was at a loss what tax to impose on the colo-
nies, but it was of the unanimous opinion that foreign and
intercolonial commerce should first be taxed. This, how-
ever, would not supply the government's needs. A poll
ux would hardly be fair to the colonies, for some of them

would be taxed more than others, especially those in which 1

slaveiy was prevalent. The colonists would never endure 1

a land tax like quitrents. An excise was held in reserve,

but was not adopted at this time. Exchequer bills for cur- ,

rency would be illegal, owing to the Acts of Parliament *

which prohibited the use of paper money in the colonies.

Parliament had to take into consideration two things : first, \

how to raise money, and, secondly, how to raise enough. «

A bill for raising money for the depleted English treasury
from colonial revenues was brought before the ministry in
1763. The resignation, however, of Charles Townshcnd
from the cabinet caused its postponement. Grenville, the
foreign secretary under Bute, did not regard the colonies as
royaJ dominions. He considered them stihiert to the crown,
but with independent parliaments. To hm they only ex-
isted as benefits to l^ritivh trade. He believed that the ,
internal taxes were just the same in principle as the cx- '
ternal taxes which Parliament had been collecting. Grcn-
vilie's great object was an American revenue that would
divide the public burden between England and her colonics.

In 1763, Greru ille convened the colonial agents in Lon- 1
don and exphiHiL J his plan. A stamp tax was to be laid
on the colonies by Act of Parliament. These agents were
to inform their respective Assemblies of his plans, and, if
those plans were not suitable, to suggest a more agreeable
tax* On September 22, 1763, the three lords of the treas-
ury, GrenvtUe, North, and Hunter, met to consider the
matter of presenting such a bill before Parliament. Charles
Jenkinson was ordered to write to the commissionen of
the stamp duties to ^ prepare the draft of a bill to be pre-
sented to Parliament for extendmg the stamp duties to the
colonies." These instructions were carried out. The tax
bill was not broug|ht before Parliament at once. There were
several motives, in fact, that caused Grenville to feel re-
luctant to present the bill at tl is time. One of them was
the opposition of the Bedford party. He therefore post-
poned the tax for a year, although stating that he would

Biirety bring it up at the end of that time. When Parliament
assembled in 1764^ Jenkinson uiged Grenville to present
the American Stamp Act, but it was not until early in 1765
that the bill came up before the House of Commons in its

final form.

The tax proposed by (Trenville was no new scheme.
Nearly forty years before the passage of the Stamp Act,
Sir William kc :th, the late Governor of Pennsylvania, had
presented an elaborate scheme to the king, proposing the
extension of the stamp duties to the colonies by Act of
Parliament. Dunbar, during his brief but exciting career
in New Hampshire, had ad vise J ihe same plan. In April,
1 734, Governor Cosby suggested to the New York Assem-
bly ^*a duty upon paper to be used in the Law and in all
conveyances and deeds." He urged it as an experiment
which niiglit bring a considerable amount of money into
the treasury. A like proposition was made by Lieutenant*
governor Cbrke to Governor Clinton in 1744. In the first
case the Assembly objected, and in the second case Clmton
did not deem the scheme expedient. Both Governor Sharpe,
of Maryland, and Governor Dinwiddie, of Vtiginia, had
advised it at the rime of the abortive attempt to unite the
colonies in 1754.

The king and the lords favored GrenvUle's scheme, in
spite of the opposition raised in several quarters. Gren-
ville, however, was not at all sure that subjects ought to be
taxed without representation. Nevertheless, be thought pol-
icy, commerce, and finance* dcmamied it. He held that the
colonies existed, in a way, for exploitation, — for the im-
provement of trade. The colonics had disregarded the Acts
of Navigation and had tlujs robbed England. He increased
the iiuniber of customs oiliccis and liistructed them to en-
force vigorously the navigation laws. The governors were
ordered to suppress illicit trade. All civil, naval, and mill*
tary officers in America were ordered to cooperate. The
commander-in-chief was to phce troops at the service of
the revenue officers, if necessary. Likewise, the execurive

head of the navy, whose officers held custom house com-
missioos with authority to enter harhors and sdze suspected
persons or cargoes, was required to do the same'.

In June, 1 764, news was received that a Stamp Act would
be introduced into the House of Commons the following
year. The people of New York were thorougjhly aroused
by the infeell^ence. Said one person: shall wear nothing
but homespun;'* ^^I shall stop drinking wine,'* said another;
"I shall dress in sheepskins with the wool on," said a third.
The English statesmen believed New York would be loyal,
even if all the other colonies rebelled. Thev were wrong.
The New York AssembU convened in September (1764),
and adopted a meniunal aJdress to the Hou^e of Commons,
in which it was said: " i he people of New York nobly dis-
dained the thought of claimmg Hbeitv as a privilege . . .
but founded the exemption iroiii ungraiitcd and compulsory
taxes, upon an honorable, solid, and stable basis, and chal-
lenged it, and gloried in it as their right/* The New York
agent in England was communicated with by a committee
appointed for the purpose, and instructed to do all in his
power to prevent the passage of the proposed laws. New
York put itself on record as considering a viobtion of her
rights and privileges, even by Parliament, an act of tynuuy,"
and that it would abhor ihc power which mi^ inflict it$
and, as soon as able, would cast it off, or perhaps try to
obtain better terms from some other power* Lieutenant-
governor Cadwallader Colden was acting governor. He
did his best to cany out the designs of the king, and got
himself heartily despised in consequence.

Grenville presented before the House fifty-five resolu-
tions embracing: all the details of the act. His argument
was that Parliament had to defend the colonies, hence Par-
liament could exact duties from the colonies to help to
pay for this defence. Beckford, a friend of Pitt, replied
to Grenvillc's argument. He urged other means besides the
Stamp Act. Colonel Isaac Barre, Wolfe's eonipanion be-
fore Quebec, taunted the House with ignorance ui American

affairs* Charles Townshend, who thought that he knew all
about such afiairs, arose, and, after an exhaustive argument
concerning the equity of the proposed taxation, ended with
this peroration :

"Will these American children, planted by our care,
nourished up to strength and opulence by our indulgence,
and protected by our arms, grudge to contribute their mite
to relieve us from the heavy burden under which we lie?'*

Bar re responded quickly, in a speech iuiown to every
schoolboy :

" They planted by your care ! No j your oppressions planted
them in America. They fled from your tyranny to a then
uncultivated, inhospitable country, where tfaej exposed
themselves to almost all the hardships to which human
nature is liable; and, among others, to the cruelties of a
savage foe, the most subtle, and I will take it upon me to
say, the most formidable of any people upon the face of
God's earth; and yet, actuated by principles of true £ng-
lish liberty, they met all hardships with pleasure, compared
with those they suffered in their own countiy from the
hands of those who should be their friends.

** T/'O' nourished by your indulgence ! They grew by your
neglect of them. As soon as you began to care about them,
that care was exercised in sending persons to rule them
in one department and another, who were, perhaps, the
deputies to some members of this House, sent to spy out
their liberties, to misrepresent their actions, ajid to prey upon
them, — men, whose behavior on many occasions has caused
the blood of those sms tf lAtrty to recoil within them ; men
promoted to the highest seats of justice; some who, to my
knowledge, were ^d, by going to a foreign country, to
escape being brought to the bar of a court of justice in
their own.

•* They protected hy ymr arm ! TTiey have nobly taken up
arms in your defence; have exerted a valor, amidst their con-
stant and laborious industry, for the defence of a country
whose frontier was drenched in blood, while its interior

believe me — remember I this day told you so — the same
spirit of frecdoin which actuated that people at first will
accompany tfaem stUL But prudence forbkU me to explain
myself ftiitlier. God knows that I do not at this time
speak from motives of party heat; what I deliver are the
genuine sentiments of my heait. However superior to
me in genend knowledge and experience the respectable
body of this House may be, yet I claim to know more of
America than most of you, having seen and been conversant
in that country. The people, I believe, are as truly loyal
as any subjects the king has ; but a people jealous of their
liberties and who will vindicate them, if ever they should
he violated. But the subject is too delicate $ I will say no
more."

The speech was extemporaneous, and was regarded as
merely a hit at Townshend. In the gallery sat Jared Inger-
soll, the agent of Connecticut. He sent a report of the
speech to New London. It was printed in the newspapers
of the town. It spread rapidly throughout New KngLuul^
and all America — even Canada, where it was translated into
French. The people seized upon Sons of Liberty *' as a
slog^.

But it was of no use — petitions and prayeis were of no
avail. We might," said Fianklin, «^as well have hbdered
the sun's setting." On February 7, 1765, the act was
ordered to be brought in. Petitions against it were sent in«
but the House ruled ^^to receive no petition against a money
bill." The petition of Virginia, however) was debated upon,
whether to receive it or not. It was not received. Finally^
the bill was passed in the House, with an opposition of
about fifty votes. An insignificant minority that betrayed
the general lack of interest and comprchensioji of the issues!

«The Stamp Act piovided for the payment, bjr Brmsh
subjects in America to the English exchequer, of specified
sums, greater or less, in consideration of obtaining validity
for each of the common transactions of business" (Palfrey).
By its terms, newspapers, almanacs, marriage certificates,
law documents, and other papers had to be stamped. It
was expected that this would bring to the English treasuiy
about ^100,000 annually. It is an open question who
was responsible for the Stamp Act. Jenkinson, being only
private secretary to the Earl of Bute, could not have been
responsible for it, although while acting in that office he
proposed such a scheme. Jcjikinson himself says: "If the
Stamp Act was a good measure, the merit of it was not due
to Grenville; if it was a bad one, the ill policy did not
belong to him." Bancroft ii&gt; of the opinion that Grenville
himself was not the responsible person. The latter even
doubted, as we have seen, the wisdom of taxii^ the colonies
without representation.

Grenville thought to soothe the feelings of the colonists
by appointing as stamp officers native Americans. Said he :
^Now, gentlemen, take the business into your own hands $
you will see how and where it pinches, and will certainly
let us know it; in which case it shall be eased.*' No one
' thought the tax would be resisted ; Fitch and Hutchinson
were quite sure that Parliament had a right to tax, and even
Otis and Franklin did not dream of active resistance — ^let
alone armed resistance.

The tax seemed ideally perfect. It would collect itself
— without the stamps, marriages would be void, notes
valueless, transfers of real estate mvalid, inheritances irre-
claimable, mortgages unren;istered. The English statesmen
applauded the tax; the Americans received it with disgust.

stroke has lost Great Rritain the afFcctiiin of all her colonies;
what can be expected but discontent for a while, and in the
end open opposition?** John Watts voiced the same sen-
timent when he said : *' The task may seem easier in theory
than prove in the execution j I cannot conceive there will
be silver or gold enough in the colonies to cariy this act
through."

Tht colonists througliout the length and breadth of the
country showed a commendable zcsL Many associations
known as Sons of Liberty were organized^ and the growth
of a most ominous feeling of unity was apparent. Each
colony adopted the method best to its liking of showing its
opposition to the policy of the Parliamentary party in con-
trol of affair*;. There were all degrees of opposition, from
the defiant attitude of Massachusetts to the outward calm
of New York. The Virginia Assembly put itself on record
to the effect that the inhabitants of that dominion inherited
from the first settlers equal franchises with the people of
Great Britain j that their rights had never been forfeited or
given up J that the General Assembly of Virginia had the
sole right and power to lay taxes on the inhabitants; and
furthermore, that no man in the colony was bound to yield
obedience to any tax law other than those made by their
own General Assembly, and whosoever should, by speak-
ing or writing, maintain the contrary was an enemy to the
colony/* Otis, of Massachusetts, suggested a most radical
step. He proposed an American congress to consider care^
fully the Acts of Parliament. His suggestion took practical
form in a circular letter sent to all the colonial Assemblies
proposing a congress to meet at New York on the second
Tuesday in October.

In the meantime, the printing press was being put to a
good use. The Stamp Act was reprinted and sold on the
streets of New ^ drk under the caption The Folly of Eng-
land and the Ruin of America. Outspoken denunciation
of the English government appeared in nearly every issue of
the newspapers; and open threats were made in numerous

pamphlets. In this mass of denunciatory material, there was
one rather sober, well-balanced essay, signed "Freeman/*
It is supposed to have been written by John Morin Scott.
Seveial quotations from this essay may prove interesting:

It is not the tax, it is the unconstitutional manner of
imposing it« that is die great subject of uneasiness in the
colonies. . . . The absurdity of our being represented in
Parliament is so glaring that it is almost an aflFront to com-
mon sense to use arguments to expose it. The taxation of
America is arbitrary and tyrannical, and what the Parlia-
ment of England has no right to impose." The English
constitution was analyzed and declared to have within itself
the principle of self-preservation, correction, and improve-
ment. "If the interests of the mother country and her
coIoiiK s cannot be made to coincide, if the same constitu-
tion may not take place in both, if the welfare of England
necessarily requires the sacrifice of the most natural rights
of the colonies, — their right of making their own laws, and
disposing of their own property by representatives of their
own choosing, — if such is really the case between Great
Britain and her colonies, then the connection between them
ou^t to cease; and sooner or later it must inevitably cease.
The English government cannot long act toward a part of
its dominion upon principles diametrically opposed to its
own, without losing itself in the slavery it would impose
upon the colonies, or leaving them to throw it off and assert
their own freedom. There never can be a disposition in the
colonies to break off their connection with the mother, so
long as they are permitted to have the full enjoyment of
those nVhts to which the Knglish constitution entitles them.
They desire no more; nor can they be satisfied with less."
This essay was copied by the newspapers of the country
and was read by the people.

Inasmuch as the stamp collectors were the material em-
bodiment of what the colonists saw fit to consider the
tyrannical policy of Parliament, they were the first objects
of the popular indignation. The question was very shortly

JSSUMFTJON Of FARUAMEHrARr CONTROL 487



debated whether or not the stamp collectors should be tol-
erated at all. Xhe English ministry seemed to irritate the
colonists in direct proportion to the extent that it attempted
to placate them. Grenvillc appointed prominent Ameri-
cans as stamp collectors, but the claim was immediately
made that such men would make the worst possible officers.
The analogy was drawn between tfaem and negro overseen,
who were always the most cruel taskmasters although of
the same race. The names of the stamp collectors were
first published in Boston on August 8th. The temper of
the colonists can be fairly well tested from the character
of a conversation that is supposed to have been carried on
between a friend of Jared Ingersoll, of Connecticut, and
another colonist. Ingersoll had just arrived from England,
duly qualified as a stamp collector. " Had you not rather
these duties should be c(illectcd by your brethren than by
foreigners ? " asked the tormer. " No, vile miscreant ! In-
deed we had not," exclaimed Daggett, of New Haven. " If
your father must die, is there no defect in filial duty in be-
coming his executioner in order to secure the hangman's
fees? If the ruin of our country is decreed, are you free
from blame for taking part in the plunder?"

Afiairs in New Engknd now rapidly came to a crisis.
In less than a week after the names of the stamp collectors
were published in Boston, Andrew Oliver, the Massachu-
setts official, was hanged in effigy from a tree near Boston.
Before the sheriff could remove the effigy, the people had
secured it and placed it upon a funeral pyre in front of the
collector's house. Chief Justice Hutchinson, who favored
the tax, now decided to take a hand in the proceedings. He
ordered the drum beat for the purpose of summoning loyal
citizens to quell the moh. But no one was bold enough to
obey his command. He then tried to disperse the throng,
but found himself suddenly compelled to flee for his life.
Oliver discreetly resigned his coUectorship next day. Nor
did the lawless element stop here. They burned Hutchin-
son's house, destroyed his furniture and books, and scattered

his pkte and ready money. His oianuscript histoiy of Mas-
sachusetts was thrown into the gutter and came near being
injured beyond repair. It must be added that the betmr
element of Boston denounced the excesses of the mob.

These lawless acts were not confined to Boston. The
stamp collector of Rhode Islanti was compelled to resign;
and when Jared Ingersoll renchcd Connecticut he was met bv
five hundred mouiued men from New F.ondon and Windham
Counties. He was thus cf nipclkd to resign by the time
he had reached Wethersfield. He rode a white horse; and
it is said someone asked him, jocosely, what he was think-
ing about. Death on a pale horse and heU following," sakl
he. He wst led to the court house, where he retd hb icsig-
natton within the hearing of the legtsbtuie. Then, swing-
ing his cap above his head, he shouted three times : " Libeity
and Property] " The stamp coOectors of New Jersey and
Pennsylvania resig^ied shortly afterward. The Soudiem
colonies, Jamaica, St. Christopher, Nova Scotia, New Brans-
wick, and Canada at first contented themselves with passing
resolutions to resist the law. Later, however, resistance in
the Southern colonies was not confined to resolutions. Alter
the Stamp Act went into effect, lawless deeds were committed
in different parts of the South — notably in North Carolina.

Interest now became centred upon New York as one of
the most important cities of the continent and the headquar-
ters of the iiritish forces in America. Stamps were sent to
New York, but James McEvers, the stamp distributor, sent
in his resignation rather than subject himself to the dangers
of receiving them. In fact, the generally disordered state of
affairs in the city led Lieutenant-governor Colden to de-
mand of General Thomas Gage sufficient military force to
suppress the sedition. The lieutenant-governor was assured
that he would be provided with a militaiy force sufficiently
strong to put down all possible disorder. Relying upon this
promise, he boldly asserted that he would do everything in
his power to have the stamped paper distributed at the time
appointed by the Act of Parliament.

These were bold words, for, in the mc nntimc, the Sons
of Liberty had been at work. So well had their task been
done, that on the 7th of October, 1765, the Stamp Act Con-
gress assembled in the City Hall at New York. Its delibera-
tions lasted through nearly three weeks. Colden declared
the congress "unconstitutional, unprecedented, and illegal."
Ships of war were moored at the wharves, and the fort was
ordered to prepare for any emergency. The commander
of the fort, Major James, rashly declared he ^ would cram
the ttamps down the throats of the people with the end of
hift tword/* But it is well said that while he was giving
iittennce to such bellicose expressions^ the people were
splitting those same throats with the jrell : ^ Unite or Die I "
— 4aken from a motto on a device representing a snake cut
into parts, to represent the colonies. Funhermore, it was
not long before James was compelled to swallow his own
words througjh the force of public indignation. Colden
fumed with rage at what he considered the lawlessness of
the people, but to no avail. The merchants displayed won-
derful self-possession and quietly prepared an agreement to
send no new orders for goods or merchandise, to counter-
mand all former orders, nnd not even to receive goods on
commission, unless the Stamp Act were repealed.

Judge Robert R. Livingston, Major John Cruger, Philip
Livmgston, Leonard Lispenard, and William Bayard repre-
sented New York in the Stamp Act Congress. Deleg^ates
were present at the congress from nine of the colonies.
Four of the colonies sympathized with the movement,
though they did not lind it convenient to choose repre-
sentatives. These were Virginia, New Hampshire, North
Carolina^ and Geoigia. ^ Here," says Frothingham (Rhe

of Pennsylvania, was soon to be known through the colo-
nies by The Farmer's Letters. Thomas McKean and Caesar
R()cln(*3 were pillars of the cause in Delaware. Edward
Tilghmaii was an honored name in Maryland. South Caro-
lina, in addition to the intrepid Gadsden, had in i homas
Lynch and John Rutledge two patriots who appear promi-
nently in the subsequent career of that colony. Thus this
body was graced by large ability, genius, learning, and com-
mon sense. It was calm in its deliberations, seeming un-
moved by the whirl of the political waters." Timothy
Ruggles, of Massachusetts, a Tory, was made chairman of
the congress, and John Cotton, clerk. Before the organiza-
tion of the congress, the Massachusetts delegation called
upon Lieutenant-governor Colden, but found him in no
mood to give the slightest official countenance to the pro-
ceedings. In fact, he assured them of his unalterable deter-
mination to execute the law to the letter.

Nevertheless, in spite of this rebuff, the congress pro-
ceeded to oreanize itself, and cnntinucd its sessions as if
completely oblivious of the proximity of the lieutenant-
governor or the existence of his threats. The rights, privi-
leges, and grievances of the colonists were the subjects
under consideration at the second day's session. It took
eleven days' debate before the congress could agree upon a
declaration of rights and grievances. Finally, with the ex-
ception of Timothy Ruggles, of Massachusetts, and Robert
Ogden, of New Jersey, the delegates present from six of
the colonies signed it. The delegates from Connecticut,
New York, and South Carolina had not been authorized
to agree to such a declaration. Notwithstanding this, the
document was accepted — each colony having one vote—
and was ordered inserted in the journal.

The congress adjourned on the a5th of October, and
arrangements were made for transmitting the proceedings
to those colonies that were not represented. The Assem-
blies of most of the colonies represented heartily approved
of the support given the document by their representatives.

T he speaker of the General Court of iVlassachusctts severely
rebuked Ruggles for his failure to sign the declaration ; and
Ogden, of New Jersey, was hanged in effigy by the people of
that colony, to incensed were they st hit wint of loyalty to
the common cause. Meanwhile, the newspapers of the day
kept the colonists in touch with the action of the difieicnt
colonial Assemblies. At the same time, the Sons of Liberty
took a most ladical step in advance by outwardly supporting,
through their Committee of Correspondence, a continenuil
union of all the colonies. They folk»wed up this interest by
publishing what support might be counted upon in case of
necessity. A stolid determination to resist the Stamp Act
at a!! hazards was clearly evidenced upon every hand.

I hese preliminaries were not attended to a day too soon;
for, about ten o'clock at night on October 23d, two days
before the adjournment of the Stamp Act Congress, a ship
laden with stamped paper was reported off Sandy Hook.
A man-of-war anchored in the harbor announced the arrival
of the ship by the firing of a cannon. The next day the
ship proceeded up the bay, accompanied by a man-of-war
and a tender. i lu re was every evidence of suppressed
wrath on the part of the populace. No overt act for the
time being was committed, but there were numerous signs
of a growing st irin. The next morning the following
notice was found posted in many conspicuous places:

Pro Patria

The lint Man that either distributes or
makes use of Stampt Paper, let him take
care of his House, Person, and Flifects.

Vox Populi.

We dare.

There was no mistaking the temper of the people now —
all were determined to resist the landing of the stamps, come
what might. The congress — still in session — said: **We
will no more submit to Parliament than to the Divan of
Constantinople/* Colden knew not what to do, and in

hit extremity summoned his Council for advice. But only
three out of the seven responded to his summons, and they
had no advice to oflbr other than that he had hmer move
in the matter very carefully. Otherwise, he might he sub-
jected to civil suits by those merchants of the city having
merchandise in the ship on the grounds of detention of
their goods. In his dilemma, the licutenant-govemor wisely
decided that it was the better part of valor to retire within
the walls of the fort, where, in case of necessity, he would
be well prepared to crush at its inception any outbreak on
the pnrt of the populace. On the 3i&lt;;t of October the colo-
nial governors subscribed to the oath necessary to enforce
the provisions of the act. ^ or the time being, however,
no governor was bold enough to take the initiative.

Thousands of people now swarmed into New York, and
the conditions were growing more threatening Jay by day.
Open threats were made by the more outspoken element
of the crowd, while others contented themselves with sing-
ing ballads more nuutial in their character than poetic. One
of these ballads seems to have been a special favorite. It
contained thirteen verses, one of which will be sufficient to
indicate the character of the other twelve:

** With the beasts of the wonrj, we wUl nunble for foody
And lodge in wild deserts and caves,
And live poor as Job, on the skirts of ttie gltibc,

we*U submit to be ilavci, brnve boys,
Bc&amp;re we*ll submit to be daves.**

We are indebted to Mrs. Lamb i^Hhttry of New Tori
d'fv) for a most vivid and interesting account of the Stamp

Act riot in that c\ty :

On the evening of October 31st, the day before the Stamp
Act was to go into effect, the merchants of New York met at
Burns's tavern for the purpose of signing a non-miportation
agreement. Said Judge Robert R. Livingston: "England wdl
suffer more by it in one year than the Stamp l ax or any
other — should others be imposed — could ever recompense.

Mefchantt bave resolved to send for no more British manu-
ftcturef, ghopkeqim will huj none, gentlemen will wear

be laid aside, and he that does not appear in homespun, or at
least in a turned coat, is looked upon with an evil eye. The
lawyers wUI not issue a writ. Merchants will not clear out
a vessel. These were all facts not in the least exaggerated}
and it is of importance that they should be known."

This evening witnessed no rioting whatever. To be sure,
a large nunibcr of boys and sailors got together in front
of the house where the mtrchants were gathered, thinking
there was tu be a " burial of liberty" or some other equally
fooHsh ceremony. When, however, they saw the mer-
chants separate peaceably, they inarched through the streets
hurrahing and whistling, but did no damage other than to
break a tew windows. Many of these merchants behmged
to the Sons of Libeny, and, in order to secure a cooperation
of merchants througliout the colomes, they resolved to ap-
point a special Committee of Correspondence. 1 hose first
appointed withdrew their names, fearing the consequences.
Finally, however, the following fearless, radical, energetic
men accepted: Isaac Sears, John Lamb, Gershom Mott,
WlUmm Wiley, and Thomas Robinson. The names of
the Phihdelphia merchants were not added until Novem-
ber 14th, and those of Boston not until December 9th.

The 1st of November witnessed most unusual demon-
strations against the obnoxious Stamp Act. Pennants were
hoisted at half-mast, and bells weie tolled continuously.
During the day notices were posted in prominent places,
giving warning that any recogiiirion by a citizen of the
validity of the stamps in current business transactions would
result in injury to his person and his property. A placard
was addressed to Lieutenant-governor Golden and delivered
at the fort toward evening, warning him of his £tte if he
did not that night nuike solemn oath before a magistrate,
and publish it to the people, that he would not execute
the Stamp Act. Things seemed ominous. The crowds

increased toward evening. Sailors came from the harbor,
countrymrn from the surrounding districts. The fort was
Strengthened by the arrival of troops from Turtle Bay; a
Strong guard was placed in the jail; and the cannon of
the merchants of Copsy Battery, near the foot of White-
hall Street, was spiked bv order of Colden. This last act
did not tend to allay the anger of the populace. About
seven o'clock an organized band of the Sons of Liberty,
led by Isaac Sears, marched to the common and hung upon
a gallows, rigged temporarily for the purpose, an effigy of
Colden and one of the Devil whispering in the former^s
ear. In the hand of the Devil was a boot — being a satire
upon the Earl of Bute, one of the staunch supporters of the
Stamp Act. From the gallows they marched down Broad^
way to the fort, accompanied by a most formidable mob
carrying candles and torches.

Another mob constructed an effigy of Colden and placed
it upon a rhaii , hich they parnried through the streets,
at every other step riddling the erfigy with bullets, by way of
making it feel at home. When they arrived at what is now
Wall Street, they stopped in front of the house of McEvers,
the stamp distributor who had resigned, and gave three
cheers. I'his mob swung the effigy within ten feet of the
fort gate, and then called to the guard to fire. They then
hurled bricks, stones, and epithets at the fort, yet without any
result. Not a word was returned, Gage having very wisely
given orders to that effect. The mob then broke into the
lieutenant-governor's coachhouse, took out his coach, and
paraded it to the common and back.

The fort fence &amp;cing Broadway had been torn down by
the soldiers, to expose any assailants to the fire from the fort.
This inflamed the mob. The boards were gathered together
in a pile, and upon them were thrown coach, chair, gallows,
effigies, and every movable thing that could be found in the
stables, and the whole set on fire. It was intended that vio-
lence should end here, but no mob ever stops where the leaders
intend it should stop. The rioters became unmanageable.

The Freemen, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of this city,
being satisfied that the stamps are not to be issued, are deter-
mined to keep the peace of the city, at all events, except
they should have other causes of complaint."

Before night, however, notices were potted diiecdy under
the above, in all the public places, inviting a meeting in the
•* Fields " on Tuesday evening, November 5tfa,and requesting
every man to come round for the purpose of storming the
fort. On Tuesday morning, November 5th, Colden wrote
the Marquis of Granby : I expect the fort will be stormed
this night, — everything in my power is done to give them a
warm reception. I hope not to dishonor the commission I
have the honor to bear, and I trust I may merit some share
of your Lordship's regard."

Mayor John Cruger came forward as the compromiser.
Coldcii \s as urged to hand the stamped paper over to the
corporal it in of the city. A deputation of merchants waited
upon him to receive his reply. He hesitated, pleading his
oath to the king and the great contempt into which the
government would &amp;I1 by concession. He was advised to
yield. By four.o'dock, a large crowd bad collected about
the City Hall to learn results. The mayor and the alder-
• men went to the fort and warned Colden of the danger
of further delay. Colden appealed to General Gage for
counael. Gage replied that a fire from the fort would be
the signal for an insurrection and the beg^ming of a civil
war. Colden promised that the stamped paper should be
surrendered to the corporation. The mayor and aldermen,
accompanied by a prodigious concourse of people of all
ranks, soon after proceeded to the fort gate, and received
the papers. Three cheers were given hy the crowd, after
seeing the paper taken to the City Hall, and peace was
restored to the city.

When the news of the passage of the Stamp Act reached
Maryland, the Assembly was not in session. Governor
Sharpe deemed it advisable not to summon a meeting of
that body, fearing the radical action it might take. Never-
theless, the people found a medium for the expression of
their feelings in the Maryland GazetU^ then the only news-
paper in the province, and Charies Cirroll of CairoUton,
William Paca, and other distinguished citizens vigorously

opposed the act. Zachariah Hood, a native of the colony,

while in England had been appointed stamp distributor.
When he arrived at Annapolis, he received much the same
reception that stamp distributors had met with in other colo-
nies. He was " flogged, hanged, and burned in effigy " in

several towns and in other ways insulted. In spite of this
unmistakable evidence of the temper of the people, Hood
persisted in retaining the office, i'he mob tore down his
house in Annapolis, and he was compelled to flee to New
York. Govcrjior Sharpe admitted to Lord Halifax that it
would require a military force to protect Hood and that if
the stamps were then to arrive an attempt would be made
to bum them.

Sharpe asked military protection of General Gage for the
stamp distributor, but the Sons of Liberty moved more
rapidly than the governor. Hood was captured and taken
before a roagistntte. He was made to swear to resign and
never take part in the execution of the Stamp Act. The
stamped paper for Maryland arrived shortly afterward on
the sloop-of-war Hawkey but as there was no authorized
person to receive it, and as the populace was threatening, it
was shipped back to England.

Sharpe next called an Assembly. A proposition from the
Assembly of Massachusetts for a general congress of repre-
sentatives from the colonies to consider the existing state of
affairs and join in a memunal to England was unanimously
approved by both houses aiid the governor. Furthermore,
on the 28th of September, a committee of the Assembly
reported a set of resolutions in the nature of a bill of
ri^ts. It was declanitoiy of &lt;*the constitutional rights and
privileges of the freemen of the province." There is no
mistaking the drift of these resolutions. They are short,
but right to the point, and assert unequivocally the claim of
the colonists of Maryland to the privileges and immunities
of British subjects guaranteed in 1632 by the charter of
Charles I. to Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore. We have
omitted the lengthy quotations from this charter appearing

at the end of the third resolution. The resolutioiis were at

follows :

I. Resohedy unammamfyy That the first adventurers and

settlers of this province of Maryland brought with them
and transmitted to their posterity, and ..11 other his Majesty's

subjects since inhabiting in this province, all the liberties,
privileges, franchises, and imniuiiiucs, that at any time have
been held, enjoyed, and poi&gt;sei&gt;&lt;»ed, by the people of Great
Britain.

II. Reso/viti\ u/ianimouily^ That it was granted by Magna
Charta, and other the good laws and statutes of England,
and confinucJ by tiie Petition and Bill of Rights, tliat the
subject should not be compelled to contribute to any tax,
tallage, aid, or other like chaiget not set by common con-
tent of Parliament.

III. Res9fwd&lt;t ufunumously^ That by royal charter, gianted
by his Majesty, king Charles L, in the eighth year of his
reign and in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred
thirty and two, to Cedlius, then Lord Baltimoie, it was, for
the encouragement of people to transport themselves and
families into this province, amongst other things, covenanted
and granted by his said Majesty for himself, his heirs, and
Siicrc'^sdrs, as followeth . • •

IV. Rciolvcdy That it is the unanimous opinion of tlus
House, that the said charter is declaratory of the con-
stitutional rights and privileges of the freemen of this
province.

V. Resolvedy unanimously ^ That trials by juries are the
grand bulwark of liberty, the undoubted birthright of every
Englishman, and consequently of every liritii&gt;h subject in
AinciKai and that the erecting other jurisdictiojis for the
trial of matters of fact, is unconstitutional, and renders
the subject insecure in his liberty and property.

VI. Rmhedj That it is the unanimous opinion of this
House, that it cannot, with any truth or propriety, be said, that
the freemen of this province of Maryland are represented
in the British Parliament.

VIL RiMohud^ wiammHttfy^ Tliat his Majesty's liege
people of this ancient piovince have always cnjuycd the
right of being governed by kws to which they themselves
have consented, in the articles of taxes and internal polity }
and that the same hath never been forfeited, or any other
way yielded up, but hath been constantly recognized by the
king and people of Great Britain.

VIII. Resolvid^ That it is the unanimtm opinion of this
House, that the representatives of the freemen of this prov-
ince, in their legislative capacity, together with the other
part of the legislature, have the sole right to lay taxes and
impositions on the inhabitants of this province, or their
property and effects ; and that the laving, imposing, levying
or collecting, any tax on or from the inhabitants of Mary-
land, under cover of any other authority, is unconstitutional,
and a direct violation of the rights of the freemen of this
province.

When the ist of November came and tiieic was no
stamped paper in the province, some persons were very
much exercised as to how business was to be transacted
legally. The Frederick County court settled that question
in a peremptory way. It declared that its business could be
transacted without the stamped paper. The clerk, out of
form, declined to comply with the orders and was com-
mitted to prison for contempt of court. He was released,
however, veiy soon after by purgine himself of contempt*
This example was followed by other courts, and there
was no further interruption of business. A mock funeral was
conducted in Fredericktown, at which the Stamp Act was the
deceased, and an effigy of Hood, the late stamp officer, was
the sole mourner. Rurlcsque addresses were delivered, and
then both the deceased and mourner were buried.

When news of the probability of the passage of a Stamp
Act bv Parliament reached America, Pennsvlvania resolved
to send Benjamin Franklin to London as a colonial agent.
There was some opposition on the part of the proprie-
tary party to his going, and it was asserted that at icai»t

three-fourths of the inhabitants opposed it likewise. How-
ever, when the question was put to the people, he was elected.
He immediately sailed for England. When the Stamp Act
was brought up, he, with other representatives of American
culonies, appealed to the minister and remonstrated against
the tax.

During his presence in EnglaniJ uii this mission, Franklin
was summoned before a coniniittee of the House of Com-
mons. In answer to questions, lie told them that the
provisions of the Stamp Act requiring gold and silver in
payment of stamped paper worked an injury to the colo-
nists, inasmuch as gold and silver were scarce. Further-
more, the inacessible roads would prevent taking stamped
paper into the interior country. He declared, furthermore,
that the late war was really a British war, made in defence
of British trade and commerce, and that the colonies had
borne their just proportion of the expenses. He stated em-
phatically, also, that the whole attitude of America toward
Great Britain before the enactment of the Stamp Act was
one of friendliness and good will. He urg^d the repeal of
the tax, if only to regain this good will.

He was asked whether the people of America would sub-
mit if the act were moderated, and replied that they would
not submit. " May not a military force carry the Stamp
Act into execution?" he was asked. His reply to this
question was : " They will find nobody in arms. They can-
not force a man to take stamps* They will not find a
rebellion; they may, indeed, make one." He also made it
clear to them that the Americans would refuse any kind
of internal tax. He was asked what the colonists would
do if an external tax were laid on the necessities of life.
To this he replied: do not know a single article im-
ported into the northern colonies but what they can either do
without or make themselves." Franklin labored earnestly
to prevent the law's being enacted, and when it was passed
he wrote to a friend: "The sun of liberty is setting; you
must light the candles of industry and economy."

I^atcr, Fmnkliii, having been asked to rccommeiu! a man
for distributor in Pennsylvania, named his friend John
Hughes. The latter was still acting m that rapacity when
the Royal Charlotu reached Philadelphia bringing stamped
paper for Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey. Her
arrival created considerable disturbance among the inhabit-
ants. As she sailed up Delaware River, all the vessels in
the harhi)r [)Lit their co!(»rs at half-mast, and the citir.ens
draped the buildings throughout tiie city in mourning. Im-
mediately thousands of people assembled to devise ways and
means of preventing the distribution of the stamps. It was
suggested that the resignatioii of Mr. Hu^es should be
requested. He was at once waited upon by a committee of
gentlemen, but flatly refused to resign his office* Had it not
been for illness in his family, the distributor might have
been subjected to mob violence. He gave assurances, how-
ever, that he would not carry out the duties of his oflice
until requested to do so by the people. The Rt^l Cbarbta
spent the winter in the Dehware, without unloading her
cann of stamps.

On the 31st of October, the day before the Stamp Act
was to go into effect, the newspapers put on signs of mourn«
ing. The editors had resolved to discontinue their pub-
lications until means could be devised to avoid incurring
the penalties incident to publishing without the necessary
stamps. On November 7th a small sheet was published at
the office of the Pennsylvania Gazette, It had no title or
mark of distinction, and was headed merely N'o Stamp Paper
to be Had. On November 14th another paper appeared,
entitled RemarknhJe Occurrrrrces^ and on the 2 I St of the same
month the regular publication of the paper was resumed.
T he public offices were closed in Pennsylvania from the
1st of November until after the news had been received
in the following May of the intended repeal of the act.
A number of merchants in Philadelphia signed the non-
importation agree tnent, although such action was decidedly
detrimental to their business interests. Prominent among

these patriots was Robert Morris, of the prosperous firm
of Wiiling and Morris. Although devotedly attached to the
mother oountiy, Morris staunchly opposed the Stamp Act.

The news of the passage of the Stamp Act had an effect
upon the people of New Jersey entirely different from that
which wc have noted in the cases of other colonics. No
outward show of lawlessness was made, and (TO\rrnor
William Franklin — illegitimate son of Iknjanun Franklin
— advised the crown officials that the spirit of resistance,
though not manifesting itself in mob violence, was neverthe-
less alert and determified. The chief stamp officer, \\ ill lani
Coxe, resigned, and the loc.tl stamp officer for Salem was
forced out of office. FuiLlicrmore, the lawyers of New
Jersey organized, and at Perth Amboy, on the 19th of Sep-
tember, before the Stamp Act was to go into efiect, they
resolved that they would not make use of the stamps for
any purpose or under any circumstances. They further-
more resolved that they would not practise their profession
until April 7, 1 766.

The Sons of Liberty were organized in New Jersey by
Febroaiy, I766,and they euphemistically advertised their de-
termination to resist the Stamp Act by swearing to ^^suppoit
the British Constitution." The representatives and mem-
bers of this organization from the eastern and western divi-
sions of that province requested the lawyers "to proceed
to business as usual without stamps.** They requested
them likewise to use their influencr "to open the courts
of justice as soon as possible.*' 1 h&lt; lawyers replied that
they would resume their practice by the ist of April, if they
did not hear from Parliament by that time. Furthermore,
that unless tiie Stamp Act were repealed or suspended, they
would unite with the Sons of Liberty in their opposition
to it.

The Grenville ministry had fallen in July, 1765, and
had been succeeded by that of Rockingham. Parliament
met on December 17, 1765, when Grenville and Bedford
strongly urged the continuance of the tax and insisted that

no relaxation or indulgence should be granted to the colo-
nists. Pitt, on the other hand, rose from a sickbed and
urged the repeal. Conway, who had all along fought the
Stamp Act, was now secretaiy of state for Sie colonies.
He brought m a bill for the repeal of the act on the ground
that it had interrupted British commerce and jeopardized
British merchants. He also told Parliament that unless the
act were repealed, Spain and France would declare war.
Jenkinson urg^ modification of the act. After Edmund
Burke had answered Jenldnson, Pitt arose and delivered a
speech of extraordinary eloquence, which had great effisct on
both sides of the Atlantic.

Arravcd against the repeal were the kin?, the queen, the
princess-dowager, the Duke of York, Lord Bute, and other
influential personages of the kingdom. Bedford predicted
the defeat of the ministry. On the day of voting, the
lobbies of the Htnisc were crammed. Three hundred mer-
chants waited anxiously for the resolution of the House.
Repeal would mean greater business ; a continuance of the
tax might jeopardize their very livelihood. When the vote
was taken on the first reading of the bill for repeal, Febru-
zry 22, 1766, two hundred and seventy-five were for and
one hundred and sixty-seven ag^nst repeal. After the
result was announced,^ the roof of St. Stephen's rung with
the long continued shouts and cheerings of the majority."
Conway was surrounded by the joyous populace as their
deliverer, while Grenville, mortified, passed in a rage, amid
the hisses of the people. Pitt was the god of the hour.
In the final vote on March 17, 1766, two hundred and fifty
were for, while one hundred and fifty were against repeal.
The next day the bill was brouL^ht before the House of
Lords, where it was finally earned. All those who voted
for repeal did so at the cost of the king's favor. Bedford
declared: "We have been beaten, but we made a gallant
fight." Burke described it as an event that caused more
universal joy throughout the British dominions than perhaps
any other that can be remembered."

Coincident with the repeal ot the Stamp Art, Parliament
asserted in the strongest and most unrestricted form the sov-
ereignty of the British Legislature. This was done first of
all by resolutions and then by a Declaratory Act. The latter
affirmed the right of Parliament to make laws binding the
British colonics "in all cases whatever." The votes of the
colonial Assemblies which had denied Parliament the right of
taxing them were condemned as unlawful. When the news
of the repeal of the Stamp Act, March 18,1766, reached New
York, the joy of the people was unbounded. On June 23d
the Assembty ordered a statue erected in Wall Street in honor
of William ritt. It was to serve as "a public testimonj of the
many eminent services he had rendered to- America, particu"
larly in promoting the repeal of the Stamp Act/' Gecarge III.
was to be honored, likewise, by an equestrian statue, and
John Sargent, agent of the colony in XiOndon, by a piece
of plate. The king's statue was erected on the Battery on
August 21, 1770, and remained there until 1776. In the
disturbance of that year it was pulled down and cast into
musket-balls for the defence of liberty against the assaults
of the one in whose honor it had been erected.

June 4, 1766, the king's birthday, was celebrated by the
erection of a mast or liberty pole "to his most gracious
Majesty, George III., Mr. Pitt, and Liberty." The pro-
vincial officials, civil and military, from the governor down,
mingled with the people in their festivities. " An ox was
roasted on each side of the common ; a large stage was built
up, on which were placed twenty-iive barrels of strong beer,
a hogshead of rum, with sugar and other materials to make
punch. At another part of the field were preparations for
a bon-fire; twen^-five cords of wood surrounded a pole, on
the top of which were affixed twelve tar^barrels. At the
upper end of the field were placed five-and-twenty pieces
of cannon; a flag displayed the colors of Great Britain, and
a band of music played G9d savt the King.**

In Philadelphia, the master of the ship bringing the
good news was presented with a gold-laced hat. Bonfires

ilhimttwicd tiie town, tad the people generally ifaowcd thdr
joj by contuming vast quantities of beer. A banquet was
held, the governor and other dignitaries being present. It is
significant that it was not until at the close oif the banquet
that the diners voted unanimously that, on the 4th of June,
the king's birthday, everyone should give his homespun to
the poor, and dress himself in clothes of British manufac-
ture. In the Lower Counties [Delaware], the rejoieuig at
the re[H-al of the act was but "equalled by the depression
upon us passage." A somewhat florid address to the king
was drawn up hv Caesar Rodney and Thomas AlcKean.
The annoiinccmciu of the repeal of the Stamp Act in Mary-
land was celebrated, as in other colonies, by bonfires, the
firing of guns, and the giving of banquets. The healths of
Pitt^ Barr6, and Camden were drunk in ^ portentous quan-
tities of punch/' and even Zachariah Hood wis permitted
to Ktum to Afinapolis and ply his kcttiiiuite vocation.

The passage of the Stamp Act and its subsequent repeal
tie two of the most impoitant events in the histmy of Great
Bricatn in her rehtion to the American colonies. The pas&gt;
sage of the act was the natural result of the French and
Indian War; its repeal w^as but the postponement for less
than a decade of the final clash between two opposing theo-
ries of governmental control. From the point of view of
George III. and bis ministr)*, it would have been better by
far not to have repealed the Stamp Act. The claim of
Parhamrnt to the prerogative of taxinfr the colonies for their
own support was botmd to clnsli with tlie ojiposinii claim of
the provincial Assemblies to be themselves the sole deposi-
tories of that prerogative. The surrender of Parliament
on March 18, 1766, but made us position in 1775 the more
difficult. Had Parlian^ent not surrendered in 1 766, the issue
would have been met at that time fairly and squarely. It
is impossible to prophesy what would have been the result
had the American Revolution been precipitated in 1766
instead of 1775. And, in fiict, there is no great certainty
that the oppositioa to the Parliamentaiy claim to sovereignty

in coluiual taxation would have gone to the extent of open
rebellion. The position of England, however, at the former
date was relatively much stronger than at the latter date,
and that of the colonies relatively weaker.

The Middle c(4ofiiea were defined to play a inoet impor-
tant part in the ttruggle Ibr independence. Centrally situ-
ated on the Atlantic seaboardf they were to serve as so
many territorial links connecting the New Engbuid with
the Southern colonies. For this reason, l^igcly, they were
to become the theatre of war and were to bou* the brunt
of the conflict. £arly in the struggle, possession of the
Champlain-Hudson valley was to be the object sought by
the British forces. Once this strategic line could be se-
cured, it would be only a short time before New England
and the Southern colonies would he defeated in detail. The
Middle colonies once secured and the two extreme"? of the
disaffected territory scpn rated, resistance to the victorious
armies of the invader could not be long sustained.

We have traced the development of the Middle colonies
from their first settlement to the repeal of the Stamp Act.
We have seen how diverse were the social elements enter-
ing into the life of these colonies. Notwithstanding this
fact, we have observed how readily they combined to offer a
united opposition to the Scamp Act in 1 765. During the
next ten years, this germ of national unity developed with
remarkable rapidity until it reached its second state in the
Declaration of Independence. An account of the events of
this period, however, forms a logical part of the history
of the American Revolution.

From the point of view of the colonies, the repeal of the
act was a great victory and carried with it momentous results.
The colonial opposition to the act was only in line with a
long series of precedents. It mattered not what external
forces claimed the prerogative of laying taxes upon the
colonies, the Assemblies were in duty homul to oppose that
claim. It v/as well fur them that the hnal crisis did not
come until a later date. 1 he decade intervening was one

of imponant developments. The Declaiatoiy Act, the
Trade Acts, and finally the Boston Port Bill, gnulually alien-
ated the colonies from the mother country. What is more
to the point, tbejr slowly but surely furnished the motive
for a closer union. Agsin,the colonies were much stronger
in 1775 than in 1 766, and the successful ending of Pontiac's
war had removed the last semblance of danger from an
external foe. During the decade a- truce was patched up
between the two contending theories of governmental con-
trol; but it was not to be of long duration. The French
and Indian War had served as a militar)' training school for
men who were to play the most important roles in the
drama of the AnKncan Revolution. The period fmm
1766 to 1775 furnished them with the opportunity of per-
fecting themselves in the parts they were to play in the
struggle from which were to emerge ^^The United States
of America."
